*Call for Applications*

The Department of Computer Science at NOVA University Lisbon invites
applications for six full-time, tenure-track Assistant Professor faculty
positions in Computer Science. We are primarily interested in recruiting
excellent candidates in the areas of the department’s research groups on
Computer Systems, Intelligent Systems, Multimodal Systems, and Software
Systems, which include:

   - Artificial Intelligence
   - Machine Learning
   - Security and Privacy
   - Computer Systems
   - Programming Languages
   - *Software Engineering*
   - Multimodal Systems
   - Human-Computer Interaction

Exceptional candidates in other areas of Computer Science will also be
considered. Tenured-level (Associate and Full Professor) applications are
also welcome.

Technology, the Department of Computer Science and existing tax incentives
for people relocating to Portugal are available at
https://www.di.fct.unl.pt/noticias/2025/03/recruitment-tenured-and-tenure-track-computer-science-faculty-members

The selection process focuses on a candidate's proven research ability and
dedication, and how their expertise complements the Department’s
established strengths. A doctoral degree in Computer Science or a closely
related field is required. Tenure-track candidates should demonstrate
exceptional research potential and the ability to work both independently
and collaboratively.

Those applying for tenured-level positions must have a distinguished
research record, international recognition, and strong leadership skills.
Experience supervising graduate students is also highly valued at this
level.

*How to apply*

We will conduct a two-stage application process.

This first stage will serve to identify suitable candidates. During the
first stage, we invite interested candidates to submit, by email to
[log in to unmask] (with the subject “Faculty call 2025a”):

   - a current CV
   - a cover letter including a short research statement
   - three sample publications

Once suitable candidates are identified and selected for further
consideration, we will proceed to the second stage by opening a formal call
to which candidates will have to apply.

For full consideration, first-stage applications must be received by *May
29, 2025*. However, applications will continue to be accepted until the
positions are filled.
