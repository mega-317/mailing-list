        "description": "Blockchain technology supports decentralized, transparent, and immutable transaction execution and storage. The advent of smart contracts has provided the opportunity to apply these characteristics for managing digital and real-world assets, and for running business logic on blockchain platforms. As blockchain technology has advanced, adoption from both industry and academia has steadily increased, driving efforts to develop new, trustworthy Blockchain‑based Information Systems (BISs). This was possible thanks to the blockchain's execution environment, offering additional trust guarantees to execute multi-party collaborations, and enhancing auditing and verification activities. Indeed, blockchain enables mutually distrusting parties to share data in a trusted way, without requiring third-party authorities.",
