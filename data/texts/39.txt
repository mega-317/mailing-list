The Section for Software Engineering and Computing Systems, at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), invites applicants for a two-year postdoctoral position within the area of Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE).

This position is funded by Innovation Fund Denmark Grand Solutions project "AI4SE1DK - Human-Centered Adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering in Denmark".

You will be part of a team of researchers from leading Danish universities and practitioners from software companies in Denmark and Sweden jointly collaborating to advance the adoption of responsible and human-centered AI in software engineering (AI4SE). The AI4SE1DK project addresses urgent industry needs by investigating how Large Language Models can be effectively, ethically, and sustainably adopted in real-world software teams.
The project will give you access to a rich ecosystem of researchers and practitioners, opportunities to publish in high-impact venues, and real-world validation of your research. Furthermore, this grant aims to significantly expand our understanding of the use of Large Language Models in Agile software development and is to be carried out in collaboration with a large industrial partner.

Join us as a Post Doctoral Researcher in Empirical Software Engineering and dive into cutting-edge research, harnessing Large Language Models for software project management. Shape the future of Software Engineering with us!

Expected start date and duration of employment:
This is a two-year fixed-term position with employment start date is 1st of November 2025, or very shortly afterwards.

The research to be addressed:
AI has been applied to Software Engineering for some time, and in areas such as software effort estimation, defect prediction, and project management in general. And more recently, the proposal of Large Language Models opened a wider range of opportunities to explore its use for Software Engineering (LLM4SE). This is the main goal of this research, i.e., to apply LLMs within the context of software project management, and in collaboration with industry.
The applicant will work in the Software Engineering Research group, which is one of several Research Groups part of the Software Engineering and Computing Systems Section at AU-ECE.

Job description:
The applicant will work in the Software Engineering Group, which is one of several Research groups part of the Software Engineering and Computing Systems Section at the department. The use of AI4SE is already being investigated within this research group, via another research project. This means that the applicant with immediately engage in a wider collaboration within the Software Engineering group, and potentially across other research groups in the SECS Section.

Your profile:
Applicants should hold a PhD degree in Computer Science or related field.
