18th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering
(SLE 2025)
12-13 June 2025

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering
(SLE) is devoted to the principles of software languages: their design,
their implementation, and their evolution.

Like its predecessors, the 18th edition of the SLE conference, SLE 2025,
will bring together researchers from different areas united by their common
interest in the creation, capture, and tooling of software languages. It
overlaps with traditional conferences on the design and implementation of
programming languages, model-driven engineering, and compiler construction,
and emphasises the fusion of their communities. To foster the latter, SLE
traditionally fills a two-day program with a single track, with the only
temporal overlap occurring between co-located events.
