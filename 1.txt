ASSOCIATE SENIOR LECTURER (TENURE TRACK) in AI for SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden

Blekinge Institute of Technology is an internationally top-ranked
research environment in empirical software engineering. Our campus
is located at the shore of the Baltic Sea in the Southeast of Sweden.
We offer study programmes in software engineering from undergraduate
to postgraduate levels.

The employment includes research, teaching, and supervision in
software engineering. The applicant is expected to actively
participate in leading and developing the department's research
and educational activities, as well as in applying for external
research funding, nationally and internationally.

The focus of the research will be on using and developing
(generative) AI to improve software development processes as well
as the quality of software artefacts (e.g., code or designs). We
are, therefore, looking for a candidate with experience from
quantitative and qualitative research and from tool development
for the collection and analysis of software development data. We
also value experience from empirical research in close
collaboration with industry or government agencies.

The teaching includes lectures, practical elements, and course
development at undergraduate and graduate levels in software
engineering. In addition, supervision of degree and project work
at undergraduate and graduate levels is included. There is also
the opportunity for the supervision of doctoral students.

Initially, the proportion of research is guaranteed to be at
least 60% of the employment. The employment comes with resources
to finance one doctoral student.

The position is a part of the strategic research area in IT and
mobile communication, ELLIIT (elliit.se), which is a partnership
between Linköping University, Lund University, Halmstad University
and Blekinge Institute of Technology. The holder of the position
is expected to contribute to ELLIIT's broader goals in research,
postgraduate education, collaboration, and dissemination.

Eligibility
Eligible to be employed as an associate senior lecturer is a
person who has completed a doctoral degree or has equivalent
scientific competence.

Preference should be given to those who were awarded a doctoral
degree or attained equivalent competence no more than five years
prior to the application deadline for employment as an associate
senior lecturer. Persons who have been awarded a doctoral degree
or attained equivalent competence earlier can be considered for
employment if special reasons exist. Special reasons refer to
leave due to illness, parental leave, or other similar circumstances.

Application deadline: August 1, 2025.
