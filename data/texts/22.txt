It is a great pleasure to invite students and young researchers to apply
for this exceptional opportunity to learn about the possibilities to pursue
a career in Software Engineering (SE) research.

We invite applications for the 5th Latin American School of SE, an
in-person event co-located with the Brazilian Conference on Software:
Practice and Theory (CBSoft 2025), which will take place in Recife,
Pernambuco, Brazil, from September 22 to 26, 2025. CBSoft is the leading
Brazilian event for the SE research community and the largest one in Latin
America. The LATAM school is scheduled for September 22nd and 23rd, 2025.

The school welcomes undergraduate, MSc, and PhD students from Latin
American institutions who are researching SE topics. We will also welcome
researchers who have defended their PhD theses in 2024 and are working in
Latin American institutions.

The main goal of the 5th edition of the LATAM school is to help new and
future Software Engineering (SE) researchers become part of the larger
software engineering community. The school will enable participants to
explore potential pathways and gain a deeper understanding of the
challenges and opportunities in SE research. Students will have an
excellent opportunity to interact with top academic and industry
researchers, learn about their careers, and discover how to disseminate
results, as well as hear about important topics that are not typically
covered in graduate courses.

Beyond the outstanding keynotes, we will provide a mentoring program where
students will have the chance to receive feedback from a renowned
researcher. Students will be grouped by software engineering topics, and
each student will have at least one mentor. The mentoring sessions will
occur with students presenting a poster with a 10-minute lightning talk
about their research. Also, mentoring sessions will last approximately 30
minutes.

For the first time in the LATAM School, there will be a panel with 3-4
experienced researchers who will answer any questions students ask about SE
research and careers in academia and industry.
Important dates

Application deadline:

June 30th, 2025

Notification date:

July 20th, 2025

LATAM School:

September 22nd and 23rd, 2025.
Eligibility

The applicants must be:

   -

   Ph.D., MSc students from Latin American institutions, or who received
   the Ph.D. degree on or after 2024, and who work in Latin American

   -

   Highly motivated undergraduate students might be accepted, and
   -

   Working with software engineering topics.

There are **limited spots** (maximum of 50 students) to be filled for this
school that will be given to Latin American applicants. We will select the
participants based on different criteria (academic background, research
topic, diversity) to ensure the adequacy of the school and diversity. We
encourage all those interested in applying!
How to apply?

You need to provide the following documents:

   -

   A structured abstract of your research with the headings:
   Context/Problem, Aims, Method, and Results (Expected Results), written in
   English. No specific template is required. The structured abstract must
   explicitly describe the research plan the students are conducting (1-page
   limit).
   -

   Poster: The poster should outline your research. It should be a balance
   of visuals and text. It must present the research overview, research
   questions, method, results obtained, and future plans.

   -

      Poster dimensions: 122cm (height) and 92cm (width). Try to use large
      fonts, such as font size 36-48 for section headings and font
size 20-28 for
      text
      -

   If the student has publications, a document containing a list of papers
   published in journals and conferences between 2022 and 2025. The document
   must present the Year of Publication, Paper Title, Conference or Journal,
   List of Authors and Link to the student DBLP pointing to the paper. We will
   mainly consider the conferences and journals available at CSIndex (
   https://csindexbr.org) - Software Engineering (list of TOP-15 best
   conferences and TOP-15 Journals). Students can also consider publications
   from the following venues:

   -

      Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering (CIbSE)
      -

      Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)
      -

      Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse
      (SBCARS)
      -

      Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing
      (SAST)
      -

      Brazilian Symposium on Software Quality (SBQS)
      -

      Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development (JSERD).

Submissions must explicitly state the names of the applicant, advisor, and
affiliation.

Submissions should be electronically made through JEMS3 (
https://jems3.sbc.org.br/latamschool2025).

Program

The school is dedicated to topics related to career and research in
Software Engineering. The LATAM School comprises activities as keynotes,
panel discussions, and mentoring sessions.

   -

   Keynote topics:
   -

      Research methodologies: Robust software engineering research involves
      the design and execution of scientific methods. The rigor involved in the
      methodology of a study is key for producing high-quality research that
      lives up to the high standards of top journals and conferences.
Therefore,
      research methodology is a central topic that will be involved in several
      school activities.
      -

      Open science: A movement for more openness, collaboration, and
      transparency in science. Even though all kinds of research artifacts are
      essential parts of research projects, there is still a lack of awareness
      and training about them worldwide. We argue that researchers should be
      aware and trained early in their career to perform research considering
      open science by construction, i.e., during the study planning
and protocol.
      -

      Industry research: Over the years, industry research has become a
      very desirable opportunity for academic researchers to
collaborate with the
      industry and target more practical problems. However, how exactly this
      works is unknown to many supervisors, which in turn remains unknown to
      students. This topic will be covered in school as a new path for
the career
      and a possible collaboration avenue for research.
      -

      Life balance and health: The rise of many mental-related health
      issues in the world, such as burnout, depression, and impostor syndrome,
      has led to a need to discuss this subject with early researchers and
      students. Working in academia can be very unstructured, and many
get overly
      involved in reaching success and ignore their health and life outside the
      workplace. Because of that, we aim to discuss the need for a life balance
      for a healthier and truly successful life.
      -

   Mentoring program: In the mentoring program, students will be grouped by
   software engineering topics and have at least one mentor. Students will
   then present a poster of their ongoing research, answer questions, and
   receive personalized feedback from the mentor. They can also ask mentors
   questions related to their projects. Students are expected to apply
   knowledge obtained from mentoring in their research projects.
   -

   Panel with Researchers in Software Engineering: The panel will be
   question-driven, with the questions made by the students. There will be 3-4
   researchers who will answer any questions students will ask that are
   related to career and research, including all the topics covered by the
   school that are mentioned above.
