Dean of School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University   

DESCRIPTION   

Singapore Management University (SMU) has started a global search for its next Dean of the School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS).  Founded in 2000, the University offers a transformative education for a new generation of graduates and leaders, and a multi-disciplinary research environment to help tackle the world's complexities and positively impact humanity. SMU has grown to become a prominent specialised university for the world of business and management. The University prides itself for its ability to generate leading-edge research with global impact and to produce broad-based, socially engaged, creative and entrepreneurial leaders.

Established in 2003, and the second largest school at SMU, SCIS is a dynamic school that is constantly seeking to uplift its research and education. SCIS aims for excellence both in fundamental contribution to academic knowledge and in creating technology with a practical impact.   SCIS is ranked #4 globally for Software Engineering based on output in 2024 on CSRankings, an influential metric on research publication in computing areas. SCIS's postgraduate programme, the Master of IT in Business (MITB), has been recently ranked #2 in Asia and #24 worldwide for the QS Business Master's Rankings 2024: Business Analytics. This demonstrates SCIS's track record in meeting the industry's demand for computing talent with a business orientation in recent years. 

As a key member of SMU's senior management team, the next Dean will be leading a rapidly growing school at an exciting juncture of the University's development. The next Dean will be able to build on the achievements of a world leading School and to advance its position known for its innovative approach to education and cutting-edge research and continue to raise the international visibility and profile of the School.
