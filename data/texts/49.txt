CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------

International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) Research Track
April 12-18, 2026
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026

Submission deadline: Friday, July 18, 2025

The International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) is the
premier forum for presenting and discussing the most recent and
significant technical research contributions in the field of Software
Engineering. In the research track, we invite high-quality submissions
of technical research papers describing original and unpublished
results of software engineering research.

IMPORTANT #1: Starting 2026, all articles published by ACM will be
made Open Access. This is greatly beneficial to the advancement of
computer science and leads to increased usage and citation of
research. Most authors will be covered by ACM OPEN agreements by that
point and will not have to pay Article Processing Charges (APC). Check
if your institution participates in ACM OPEN. Authors not covered by
ACM OPEN agreements may have to pay APC; however, ACM offers several
automated and discretionary APC Waivers and Discounts.

Update (April 21): Authors from institutions not participating in ACM
Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they
qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver. Understanding that
this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a
temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time
for institutions to join ACM Open. With the subsidy, the APC will be
$250 for ACM/SIG members and $350 APC for non-members. This represents
a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged to help
advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this
transition period

IMPORTANT #2: Submissions must follow the latest “IEEE Submission and
Peer Review Policy” and “ACM Policy on Authorship” (with associated
FAQ, which includes a policy regarding the use of generative AI tools
and technologies, such as ChatGPT.

IMPORTANT #3: For the second submission cycle, it is no longer
mandatory to register a paper with a title and an abstract, but we
encourage you to register your submissions early. There will be no
extensions to the submission deadline.

# Research Areas
----------------

ICSE welcomes submissions addressing topics across the full spectrum
of Software Engineering, being inclusive of quantitative, qualitative,
and mixed-methods research. Topics of interest include the following
and are grouped into the following nine research areas. Please note
that these topics are by no means exhaustive.

Each submission will need to indicate one of these nine areas as the
chosen area. Optionally, the authors can consider adding an additional
area. A paper may be moved from the chosen area(s) to another focus
area at the discretion of the program chairs. Program chairs will
ultimately assign a paper to an area chair, considering the authors’
selection, the paper’s content, and other factors such as (if
applicable) possible conflicts of interest.

# Scope
-------

Since the authors will choose an area for their submission, the scope
of each area becomes important. Some submissions may relate to
multiple areas. In such cases, the authors should choose the area for
which their paper brings the maximum new insights. Moreover, authors
also have the choice of indicating an alternate area for each paper.

Similarly, for certain papers, authors may have a question whether it
belongs to any area, or is simply out of scope. For such cases, we
recommend that the authors judge whether their paper brings new
insights for software engineering. As an example, a formal methods
paper with a focus on hardware verification may be deemed out of scope
for ICSE. In general, papers that only peripherally concern software
engineering and do not give new insights from the software engineering
perspective would be less relevant to ICSE. Our goal is, however, to
be descriptive, rather than prescriptive, to enable authors to make
their own decisions about relevance.

# Dual Submission Cycles
------------------------

ICSE 2026 will have two submission cycles.  The first submission cycle
is already in progress, please submit to the second submission cycle.

* Second submission cycle
  - Submission: July 18, 2025
  - Author response period (3 days): September 23-25, 2025
  - Notification: October 17, 2025
  - Revision due: November 14, 2025
  - Camera-ready (of directly accepted papers): TBA
  - Final decision (of revised papers): December 19, 2025
  - Camera-ready (of accepted revised papers): TBA

All dates are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12h).

# Review Criteria
-----------------

Each paper submitted to the Research Track will be evaluated based on
the following criteria:

i) Novelty: The novelty and innovativeness of contributed solutions,
problem formulations, methodologies, theories, and/or evaluations,
i.e., the extent to which the paper is sufficiently original with
respect to the state-of-the-art.

ii) Rigor: The soundness, clarity, and depth of a technical or
theoretical contribution, and the level of thoroughness and
completeness of an evaluation.

iii) Relevance: The significance and/or potential impact of the
research on the field of software engineering.

iv) Verifiability and Transparency: The extent to which the paper
includes sufficient information to understand how an innovation works;
to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted; and
how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the
paper’s claimed contributions. Any artifacts attached to or linked
from the paper will be checked by one reviewer.

v) Presentation: The clarity of the exposition in the paper.

Reviewers will carefully consider all of the above criteria during the
review process, and authors should take great care in clearly
addressing them all. The paper should clearly explain and justify the
claimed contributions. Each paper will be handled by an area chair who
will ensure reviewing consistency among papers submitted within that
area.

The outcome of each paper will be one of the following: Accept,
Revision, or Reject. We now elaborate on the Revision outcome in the
following.

# Revisions
-----------

Papers submitted can go through revisions in response to specific
revision requests made by the reviewers. Authors of papers receiving a
Revision decision are expected to submit the revised papers, as well
as the revised papers with changes marked in a different color, such
as using LaTeXdiff. The authors must also submit an “Author Response”
document capturing the authors’ response to each reviewer’s comment
and how those comments were addressed in the revision. This is similar
to the “Summary of Changes and Response” document that is typically
submitted by authors for a journal paper’s major revision. Authors may
use the revision opportunity to revise and improve the paper, but
should not use this to submit a substantially different paper. The
reviewers will check the revised paper against the original paper and
the suggested changes. Revised papers will be examined by the same set
of reviewers. An unsatisfactory revised paper will be rejected.
Authors are given approximately 4 weeks to submit the revised papers.
Authors are given an additional page of text in a revised paper to
accommodate the required changes specified in the reviews.

# Resubmissions of Rejected Papers
-----------------------------------

Authors of papers that receive a REJECT decision in the first
submission cycle are strongly discouraged from resubmitting them to
the second submission cycle. However, in exceptional cases where the
authors feel that the reviewers misunderstood their paper, authors can
resubmit their paper to the second submission cycle with a
“Clarifications and Summary of Improvements” document stating how they
have changed the paper. They should also include the past reviews as
part of this document, for completeness. These papers will be treated
as new submissions, which may or may not get the same set of reviewers
at the discretion of the PC chairs. Authors who try to bypass this
guideline (e.g., by changing the paper title without significantly
changing the paper content, or by making small changes to the paper
content) will have their papers desk-rejected by the PC chairs without
further consideration.

# Submission Process
--------------------

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at the time of
submission, to the official “ACM Primary Article Template”, which can
be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template page. LaTeX users should
use the sigconf option, as well as the review (to produce line numbers
for easy reference by the reviewers) and anonymous (omitting author
names) options. To that end, the following LaTeX code can be placed at
the start of the LaTeX document:

\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}

All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive
of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing
only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF.
Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of
the camera-ready version.

Submissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings
formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font
size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result
in desk rejection without further review.

By submitting to the ICSE Technical Track, authors acknowledge that
they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and
Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. In particular,
papers submitted to ICSE 2026 must not have been published elsewhere
and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst
under consideration for ICSE 2026. Contravention of this concurrent
submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific
ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To
check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve
the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of
other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external
plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to
detect violations of these policies.

If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must
adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human
Participants and Subjects. Upon submitting, authors will declare their
compliance with such a policy. Alleged violations of this policy or
any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result
in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential
penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you
can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM and
IEEE have been involved in ORCID and may collect ORCID IDs from all
published authors. We are committed to improving author
discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to
ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID
will help in these efforts.

The ICSE 2026 Research Track will employ a double-anonymous review
process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The
authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review
process. In particular:
  - Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission.
  - All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person.
  - While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or
similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was
submitted to ICSE 2026.
  - All communication with the program committee must go through the
program committee chairs. Do not contact individual program committee
members regarding your submission.
  - Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the
double-anonymous review process can be found on the Q&A page.

By submitting to the ICSE Research Track, authors acknowledge that
they conform to the authorship policy of the IEEE, the submission
policy of the IEEE, and the authorship policy of the ACM (and
associated FAQ). This includes the following points related to the use
of Generative AI:
  - “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be
listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI
tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be
fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include
the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work:
ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including
text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are
uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool,
err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the
acknowledgements section of the Work.” - ACM
  - “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an
article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any
paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of
the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI
system used to generate the text.” - IEEE
  - “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve
the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a
typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar,
punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing
system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose
such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM

Submissions to the Technical Track that meet the above requirements
can be made via the Research Track submission site by the submission
deadline. Any submission that does not comply with these requirements
may be desk-rejected without further review.

Submission site: https://icse2026.hotcrp.com/

We encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can
submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous
reviewing. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to ensure that
the formatting guidelines, double anonymous guidelines, and any other
submission guidelines are met at the time of paper submission.

IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, ACM Transactions on
Software Engineering and Methodology, and ICSE 2026 are participating
in the Sustainable Community Review Effort (SCRE) program, aimed at
reducing community effort in reviewing journal extensions of
conference papers and allowing authors to get faster and more
consistent feedback. More information is available at:

# Open Science Policy
---------------------

The research track of ICSE 2026 is governed by the ICSE 2026 Open
Science policies. The guiding principle is that all research results
should be accessible to the public and, if possible, empirical studies
should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the
adoption of open artifacts and open-source principles. We encourage
all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated)
data/artifacts to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note
that sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or
acceptance. However, sharing is expected to be the default, and
non-sharing needs to be justified. We recognize that reproducibility
or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that,
similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face
challenges in sharing research data. For guidelines on how to report
qualitative research to ensure the assessment of the reliability and
credibility of research results, see this curated Q&A page.

Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked
  - to make their artifact available to the program committee (via
upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository)
– and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or
  - to include in the submission an explanation as to why this is not
possible or desirable; and
  - to indicate in the submission why they do not intend to make their
data or study materials publicly available upon acceptance, if that is
the case. The default understanding is that the data and/or other
artifacts will be publicly available upon acceptance of a paper.

# Withdrawing a Paper
---------------------

Authors can withdraw their paper at any moment until the final
decision has been made, through the paper submission system.
Resubmitting the paper to another venue before the final decision has
been made without withdrawing from ICSE 2026 first is considered a
violation of the concurrent submission policy and will lead to
automatic rejection from ICSE 2026 as well as any other venue adhering
to this policy. Such violations may also be reported to appropriate
organizations e.g., ACM and IEEE.

# Conference Attendance Expectation
-----------------------------------

If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is
required to register for ICSE 2026 and present the paper. We are
assuming that the conference will be in-person, and if it is virtual
or hybrid, virtual presentations may be possible. These matters will
be discussed with the authors closer to the date of the conference.

We look forward to your contributions!
