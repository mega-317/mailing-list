Description
The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science hereby invites applications for a senior lectureship in Computer Science with a specialisation in AI Engineering.

The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science consists of two research subjects, Mathematics and Computer Science, and has a staff of around 100 people. The research and education in Computer Science is focused on distributed systems and communications, security and privacy, and software quality. The Department works closely with international, national, and regional partners from the academic community as well as private businesses. Close collaboration between research groups and focus areas is vital to the Department.

The senior lecturer in AI Engineering will be an important person for further extending the expertise in the research group on Software Quality and Digital Modernization (SQuaD) and the overall department.

The SQuaD group specialises on software engineering aspects related to software quality. For example, software quality assurance, software architecture and software process improvement, toward applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Duties
The position includes contributions to both teaching and research in the AI domain. You are expected to conduct innovative research in AI Engineering contributing to SQuaD as well as to the overall department in collaboration with its other research groups. You are expected to expand the department’s research competencies related to engineering AI-based systems by expertise in relevant areas, such as MLOps, quality assurance and evolution of  AI-based systems, or optimizing architectures of models and AI-based systems.

Striving for research collaboration with other colleagues at the Department, industry, and other academics is of paramount importance. The candidate is expected to expand our international networks and contribute to an increase in research funds on a national and international level.

You are expected to actively contribute as a lecturer for first-cycle and second-cycle courses, with a focus on delivering cutting-edge AI/ML content. This includes teaching courses that align with your research expertise, such as MLOps, quality assurance and evolution of AI-based systems, and optimizing architectures of models and AI-based systems. Lecturing in other areas in the broader computer science curriculum can also be expected. Duties also include course administration and development, and degree project supervision on first-cycle and second-cycle levels.

You are expected to collaborate with the wider community for a mutual exchange, as well as work towards ensuring that the knowledge and expertise available at the university is of benefit to society.

To contribute to a positive work environment and further the department’s activities, you are expected to be a present and active part of the day-to-day operations and workplace community.
