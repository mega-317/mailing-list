IEEE Artificial Intelligence x Software Engineering (aka AIxSoftware)

October 1-3, 2025
The Hills Hotel, Laguna Hills, California
http://www.AIxSE.org
Hybrid

Co-located with AIxSET, AIxHEART, AIxB

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is concerned with computing technologies that allow machines to see, hear, talk, think, learn, and solve problems. The huge potential of applying AI to problem-solving represents an exciting future in business objectives that can be achieved much more effectively. In addition, business-business, business-customer, and customer-customer may be interconnected in a revolutionary way to stimulate a tremendous amount of interesting activities.

Software Engineering (SE) deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of computer software. With the recent advances of AI, we think it is the right time to address the broader impacts of AI on SE and vice versa.​ Artificial Intelligence x Software Engineering (AIxSE) is an international forum for academia and industries to exchange visions and ideas in the state of the art and practice, as well as to identify the emerging topics and define the synergy between the research in AI and SE in general.

TOPICS OF INTEREST​​ include all aspects of SE that may be assisted by AI, such as:​
- Software design
- Requirements engineering
- Automatic programming
- Software development
- Software testing
- Software maintenance​​

AI Technologies that may be advanced by SE applications, such as:
- Generative AI
- Transformer based technology
- Agent technology
- Semantic computing
- Decision making
- Machine learning
- Symbolic AI including Knowledge and data engineering, planning
- Problem solving
- Knowledge discovery
- Knowledge integration
- Multi-modal interactions

Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. Distinguished quality papers presented at the conference will be selected for the best paper/poster awards and for publication in internationally renowned journals.
