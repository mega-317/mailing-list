IEEE AIoT 2024 aims at bringing together interested parties (universities,
research centers, industries and stakeholders) from around the world
working in the fields of AI and Internet of Things to exchange opinions,
discuss brand-new ideas, developing innovative and emerging solutions, and
establishing new collaborations.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are two of
the most rapidly evolving and interdependent fields of technology. The
convergence of these two fields is leading to the creation of an emerging
interdisciplinary field, dubbed the Artificial Intelligence of Things
(AIoT). The AIoT represents the integration of AI technologies into IoT
systems and devices, enabling them to interact with their environment in
more sophisticated and intelligent ways. By combining IoT with AI, the data
collected by distributed nodes can be utilized by applying AI techniques
such as machine learning and deep learning. As a result, machine learning
capabilities are moved closer to the data source.

The IEEE AIoT Conference aims to explore the integration of artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies into the Internet of Things (IoT) systems
and devices, enabling them to interact with their environment in more
sophisticated and intelligent ways. The conference will focus on the
following areas:
l  AIoT Architectures, Frameworks, and Algorithms: Developing novel AIoT
architectures, frameworks, and algorithms for deploying state-of-the-art
machine learning and deep learning algorithms on IoT and edge devices,
realising the so-called Edge AI or Edge Intelligence;
l  AIoT Applications: Identifying and exploring new AIoT applications,
including healthcare, smart homes, industrial automation, transportation,
and digital agriculture;
l  Standards and Interoperability: Developing standards and protocols for
AIoT systems and ensuring interoperability between different platforms and
devices; and
l  Ethics and Security: Addressing ethical and security concerns related to
AIoT, such as privacy, transparency, and accountability.

Authors are cordially invited to submit their original papers within the
eHealth area. The topics include but are not limited to:
1.     1. Edge AI and Distributed Intelligence
2.     Machine Learning for IoT Applications

Paper Format and Submission
Perspective authors are invited to submit their papers using EDAS. A full
paper should not have more than six (6) IEEE style pages including results,
figures and references. One (1) extra page is allowed with an extra charge
of $100. Papers will be reviewed with the standard reviewing procedure
(with at least 3 independent anonymous reviews). All of the accepted papers
will be published on IEEE Xplore®. Articles selected for publication in
journals must meet the conditions against self-plagiarism.

The submitted manuscripts shall be prepared in LaTeX or Word using the
official IEEE templates. Final submission of the manuscript will be in PDF
format, and make sure that the file will print on a printer that uses
letter size (8.5 x 11) paper. The official language of the meeting is
English.
