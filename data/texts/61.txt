********************************************************************************
************************** ESOP 2026 - Call for Papers *************************
********************************************************************************


ESOP is an annual conference devoted to fundamental issues in the specification,
design, analysis, and implementation of programming languages and systems.

ESOP seeks contributions on all aspects of programming language research
including, but not limited to, the following areas:

 * programming paradigms and styles
 * methods and tools to specify and reason about programs and languages
 * programming language foundations
 * methods and tools for implementation, concurrency and distribution
 * applications and emerging topics

Contributions bridging the gap between theory and practice are particularly
welcome.


Important Dates
===============

ESOP 2026 features a two-round submission scheme.

Round 1:

 * Submission deadline: June 3, 2025
 * Rebuttal: July 21-23, 2025
 * Notification: August 1, 2025

Round 2:

 * Submission deadline: October 16, 2025
 * Rebuttal: December 8-10, 2025
 * Notification: December 22, 2025

Please note that the deadlines are firm and will not be extended!

The important dates are available in the Joint Call for Papers:
https://etaps.org/2026/important-dates



Submission Categories
=====================

ESOP 2026 solicits three forms of contributions:

 * Research Papers are articles that advance the state-of-the-art on the theory
   and practice of programming languages and systems.
   For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in
   Springer’s LNCS, ACM’s PACMPL, or ACM’s TOPLAS format. There is no page limit
   for submissions, but authors should be aware that reviewers are likely to
   balance the review time for all papers and that camera-ready papers may not
   exceed 25 pages (excluding bibliography) and must be formatted in Springer’s
   LNCS.

 * Experience Reports are articles reporting on systems and techniques
   developed in practice, such as artifacts, tools, mechanized proofs, and
   educational systems, both in academic and industrial settings. These
   articles must include a critical evaluation of the experience reported.
   Submitted and camera-ready experience report papers must be formatted in
   Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography).

 * Fresh Perspectives are articles that promote new insights on programming
   languages and systems in a particularly elegant way. These papers may offer
   new tutorial perspectives of known concepts, or they may introduce fresh new
   insights and ideas that could lead to relevant future developments. Submitted
   and camera-ready fresh perspective papers must be formatted in Springer’s
   LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography).

The paper review process will be double-blind. Authors must make a good faith
effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves
either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or
acknowledgments).

Accepted papers will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series. Springer’s formatting style files and other information can be
found on the Springer website.

The papers can be submitted here: https://esop26.hotcrp.com/


Paper Submission And Evaluation
===============================

We welcome paper submissions at both submission rounds. Submissions of each
round will be reviewed by the PC and external reviewers for their technical
soundness and originality.

Round 1 submissions will receive one of three outcomes: Accept, Reject, Revise.
In the latter case, the PC will provide a concrete list of revision requests to
be completed by the Round 2 submission deadline. Such revised submissions will
be reviewed by the same set of reviewers and will either be accepted or
rejected. Rejected Round 1 submissions may NOT be resubmitted to Round 2.

Papers submitted directly to Round 2 will either be accepted or rejected.


Artifact Evaluation
===================

ESOP 2026 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation.
Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper
notification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.

Detailed information will be announced later.

Journal-First Submissions
=========================

We welcome research papers submitted via a Journal-First channel at TOPLAS.

1. Authors submit their papers directly to TOPLAS before the Round 1 submission
   deadline, and in their cover letter indicate that they want their paper to be
   considered as an ESOP Journal-First paper.
2. Reviewing is handled exclusively by TOPLAS.
3. (Optionally, but highly recommended:) Authors notify the ESOP PC chair of
   their TOPLAS submission, so that the PC chair can follow up with the TOPLAS
   editor-in-chief about the status of these submissions.
4. If a TOPLAS Journal-First paper is accepted before the end of the Round 2
   rebuttal period date, and the ESOP PC agrees, it may be presented at ETAPS.


Journal-After Submissions
=========================

Revised and expanded versions of accepted ESOP research papers are eligible for
the ESOP Journal-After TOPLAS channel. A call will open in January after the
ESOP notification. More details will be provided at a later moment.
