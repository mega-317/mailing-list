Algorithmic artists, a.k.a generative artists, use code as a medium to 
produce artworks. When the code executes, it can drive any number of 
processes, from generating visuals and/or sound, to responding to user 
interactions or choreographing movements of robotic elements, among 
others. The code also includes some non-deterministic elements such as 
random numbers, live data processing or inputs from the audience. There 
exists a large number of software engineering concerns in relation to 
this artistic practice, spanning maintenance, evolution, programming 
abstractions and performance. For example, the “correctness” of the 
artistic output is non-trivial to measure as output aesthetics are 
difficult to formally quantify.  The maintenance, preservation and 
restoration of algorithmic artworks is challenging, as they may rely on 
outdated runtimes or libraries, on online resources that quickly become 
unavailable, or on technology that is no longer available. It is 
challenging to balance performance for real-time interactions and 
domain-specific abstractions that support artistic expression with code.

With this special issue, we aim to open a conversation between software 
engineers, generative artists and caretakers of these artworks, about 
the latest advancements at the intersection of software technology and 
algorithmic art. We encourage the development and application of 
software technology to strengthen all aspects of the software 
engineering lifecycle in algorithmic art projects. We encourage the 
authors to make their code and data publicly accessible.
