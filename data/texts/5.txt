*** Call for Papers and Workshop & Tutorial Proposals ***


The 33rd IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and

Reengineering (SANER 2026)


17-20 March, 2026, 5* St. Raphael Resort and Marina, Limassol, Cyprus


https://conf.researchr.org/home/saner-2026



The 33rd edition of the IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and

Reengineering (SANER 2026) invites high-quality submissions of papers describing original

and unpublished research results. We encourage submissions describing various types of

research, including empirical, theoretical, and tool-oriented studies.



TOPICS OF INTEREST


The topics of the submissions should be of direct interest to the software analysis, evolution,

and reengineering community (including researchers, practitioners, educators). Topics of

interest include, but are not limited to:


• AI for Software Engineering and Software Engineering for AI (see note below);

• Generative AI and LLM applied to analysis, evolution and reengineering of software;

• Software Analysis, Parsing, and Fact Extraction;

• Software Maintenance and Evolution, Evolution Analysis;

• Software Reverse Engineering and Reengineering;

• Program Comprehension;

• Software Architecture Recovery and Reverse Architecting;

• Program Transformation and Refactoring;

• Mining Software Repositories and Software Analytics;

• Software Visualization;

• Software Reconstruction and Migration;

• Program Repair;

• Software Release Engineering, Continuous Integration and Delivery;

• Software Tools for Software Evolution and Maintenance;

• Human factors and legal aspects in the context of Software Analysis, Evolution and

Reengineering

• Empirical studies on all the above topics;

• Education related to all of the above topics.


Papers involving AI must either (a) concern a software system as a whole, or a subsystem, and

not simply its AI or ML component, (b) consider software engineering artifacts, (c) target a

novel context for a software engineering task, or (d) study human, social, socio-technical, and

organizational aspects in the development of AI-intensive software systems (see also “Scoping

Software Engineering for AI: The TSE Perspective”, 10.1109/TSE.2024.3470368). Other papers

may fit more AI- or ML-specialized venues instead.

Important Note: Research, Short Papers and Posters, ERA, and RENE Tracks follow a double-

anonymous review process.



SPECIAL JOURNAL ISSUE


Authors of selected research papers accepted at SANER 2026 will be invited to submit revised,

extended versions of their manuscripts for a special issue featured by Springer’s Empirical

Software Engineering Journal (EMSE). The best papers from the conference will be awarded.



CALL FOR WORKSHOPS


In SANER 2026, we solicit proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the main

conference. Workshops can be full or half-day and should highlight a specific topic of interest

related to software analysis, evolution, and reengineering. We encourage workshop organizers

to include activities that provide their participants with a true workshop experience.


All workshops will tentatively be scheduled for the first day of the conference (March 17,

2026), the day before the main conference.


Should you be interested in joining SANER, please keep the deadlines below in mind.


Submission Instructions


Proposal submission: By 20th August, 2025 AoE, the workshop proposal (in the form of call

for papers) should be submitted to the workshops EasyChair page:

https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=saner2026 .

The submission could be a PDF file (no more than two pages) or a public link to a call for

papers webpage.


The call for papers should include:

• a workshop title,

• a description of the workshop topic and scope,

• an indication of whether the workshop will take ½ day or a full day,

• a link to the workshop website,

• and the contact information.


The website should be live and include (at least) the following information: the topic of the

workshop, its scope, list of topics of interest, names of the organizing committee members

and their affiliations, types of submissions and the important dates as follows (all dates are

23:59h AoE):

• Abstract Submission: 12 December, 2025

• Paper Submission: 18 December, 2025

• Notification: 14 January, 2026

• Camera-Ready: 20 January, 2026


Evaluation Criteria


The proposals will be evaluated by the workshops track chairs based on the novelty of the

workshop topic, its importance to the field, as well as the composition of the

organizing team.


Workshop PC and Submission System


No later than mid of September 2025, the workshop PC should have been finalized and the

paper submission system should be live. Workshop organizers are free to select EasyChair,

HotCRP or any other commonly used paper submission system.


The workshop proceedings will be included in a separate section of the conference’s

proceedings – the companion proceedings.



CALL FOR TUTORIALS


The SANER 2026 Workshops & Tutorials track invites practitioners and researchers to deliver

insightful tutorials on various topics related to Software Analysis, Evolution, and

Reengineering.


These tutorials aim to expand the community’s understanding of advanced software

engineering topics, valuable tools and technologies, as well as research methodologies.


We are soliciting abstracts with the intention of presenting a tutorial in the following categories:


1 - Technical Tutorial: Speakers present the use of a tool or technology that aids the

developers in Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering.

2 - Research problem: Speakers provide a general view of the state-of-the-art for a topic

related to Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering and further present details of a

specific research problem that still needs to be addressed by the community.


Submission Instructions


The proposal should not exceed one page (with up to one additional page for references) and

should outline the talk. Furthermore, it should follow the IEEE Conference Proceedings

Formatting Guidelines (title: 24pt, text: 10pt; LaTeX users: \documentclass[10pt,conference]

{IEEEtran}). All proposals must be submitted in PDF format through

https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=saner2026. The submission should include:

• Learning objectives,

• Details on any hands-on activities (e.g., participants using a tool or completing exercises)

and the necessary computer specifications,

• Preferred dates (please note that date preferences cannot be guaranteed).


Evaluation Criteria
