*** General Information

The 29th Ada-Europe International Conference on Reliable Software
Technologies (AEiC 2025) returns after 11 years to Paris, France.
The conference schedule comprises keynote and invited talks,
a journal track, an industrial track, a work-in-progress track,
a vendor exhibition, parallel tutorials, and satellite workshops.
There will be time for networking during breaks and lunches, as well
as various social events.

AEiC 2025 is the latest in a series of annual international conferences
started in the early 80's, under the auspices of Ada-Europe, the
international organization that promotes knowledge and use of the Ada
programming language and reliable software in general, into academic
education and research, and industrial practice.

The Ada-Europe series of conferences has over the years become
a leading international forum for providers, practitioners and
researchers in reliable software technologies.  These events
highlight the increased relevance of Ada in general and in safety-
and security-critical systems in particular, and provide a unique
opportunity for interaction and collaboration between academics and
industrial practitioners.

The 2025 edition of the conference continues a number of important
innovations started in previous years:
- reduced conference registration fee for all authors;
- extra low registration fee Ada Developers workshop;
- journal-based open-access publication model for peer-reviewed papers;
- compact program with two core days (Wednesday & Thursday);
- tutorials on Tuesday, followed by welcome event for all participants;
- workshops on Friday, optional chill event on Thursday evening.

*** Overview of the Week

- Tue 10: 4 half-day tutorials, 1 full-day tutorial, welcome reception;
- Wed 11: core technical program, conference banquet;
- Thu 12: core technical program, post conference chill-out;
- Fri 13: 3 full-day workshops.

Extensive information on AEiC 2025 will be on the conference website,
such as an overview of the program, the list of accepted papers and
presentations, and descriptions of workshops, tutorials, keynote and
invited presentations, and social events.  Also check the conference

*** Venue
<http://www.ada-europe.org/conference2025/venue.html>

The conference will take place at Mines Paris, a founding member of
Université PSL, a leading French engineering school and the French
leader institution in research partnerships.  It is located along the
Luxembourg gardens, next to the Quartier Latin, and is close to public
transportation, including line B of the RER to Charles De Gaulle airport
(CDG).

Paris, the capital city of France, is renowned for its rich history,
stunning architecture, and vibrant culture.  Often referred to as "The
City of Light," Paris is home to iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel
Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral.  If you can stay
over before or after the conference, there's a lot to see.  Check the
Practical Information section of the conference website for more info.

*** Invited Speakers
<http://www.ada-europe.org/conference2025/keynotes.html>

This year the conference will once more feature keynotes and invited
talks.  All will address topics of relevance in the conference scope,
with time for questions and answers.

- On Wed morning, June 11, a keynote talk by Stefano Zacchiroli,
  of Télécom Paris, France, on "Building a Safer Open Source Supply
  Chain with Software Heritage, the Great Library of Source Code".

- On Wed afternoon, June 11, an invited talk by Tullio Vardanega,
  from University of Padua, Italy, on "Language Ownership: Key Moments
  in the Lifetime of Ada".

*** Conference Core Composition

The core conference program features three distinct types of technical
presentations, with different duration, in addition to the keynote and
invited talks: journal-track talks (25 minutes), industrial-track talks
(20 minutes), vendor presentations (15 minutes), work-in-progress-track
talks (10 minutes).

All papers presented in the journal track, the industrial track and
the work-in-progress track have undergone peer review.  Presentations
are combined into by-theme and not by-track sessions, in order that
authors and participants alike enjoy all flavors of the program in
a mixed as opposed to segregated combination.

The list of accepted papers and presentations, and the detailed
schedule, will be announced shortly.
