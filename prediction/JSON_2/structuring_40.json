        "title": "SI of the IEEE Computer Magazine on Software Engineering in Generative Art",
        "url": "https://www.computer.org/digital-library/magazines/co/cfp-software-engineering-generative-art",
        "description": "Algorithmic artists, a.k.a generative artists, use code as a medium to produce artworks."

      "discussion": {
        "details": "When the code executes, it can drive any number of processes, including generating visuals and/or sound, responding to user interactions, or choreographing movements of robotic elements. The code includes non-deterministic elements such as random numbers, live data processing, or audience inputs. There exist software engineering concerns related to maintenance, evolution, programming abstractions, and performance."

      "challenges": {
        "challenges": [
          "Measuring the correctness of artistic output is non-trivial as output aesthetics are difficult to formally quantify.",
          "Maintaining, preserving, and restoring algorithmic artworks is challenging due to outdated runtimes or libraries, reliance on quickly unavailable online resources, and obsolete technology.",
          "Balancing performance for real-time interactions and domain-specific abstractions that support artistic expression with code."
        ]

      "aim": {
        "goal": "To open a conversation between software engineers, generative artists, and caretakers about advancements at the intersection of software technology and algorithmic art."
      },
      "encouragement": "Encouragement to develop and apply software technology to strengthen all aspects of the software engineering lifecycle in algorithmic art projects, and to make code and data publicly accessible.",
