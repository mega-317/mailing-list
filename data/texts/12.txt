*Special issue on Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Software *

*ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology*

A special issue on Agentic AI in Software is planned in TOSEM in 2026, 
and papers are being solicited for this purpose. AI has had significant 
impact in SE affecting various branches in Software Engineering (SE) 
including coding, testing, analysis, patching, documentation, and even 
design. Lately with the arrival of Large Language Model (LLM) agents – 
the discipline of SE has seen further shifts. The autonomous deployment 
of tools with LLM backends gives the agents tremendous power and 
potential in bringing greater automation to SE tasks. At the same time, 
greater automation in SE tasks, does not immediately mean greater 
productivity gains. There exists lot of concerns around trust in the 
output produced by agents and the amount of manual effort needed to 
integrate agent workflows into software engineering workflows. Further, 
asoftware engineer's creativity is not only from own thought - but can 
be triggered by interactions among team members, or from feedback given 
in a team meeting. This special issue will invite original research 
articles on automation due to agentic AI in software, and its impact on 
future software teams. Papers can be under various categories, including 
the following. Authors can mention one of these categories in the cover 
letter of the paper.

  * [Auto] Automation of SE tasks via agents
  * [Trust] Enhancing trust in agent outputs
  * [Integrate] Integration of agents into existing software workflows
  * [A-H] Agent – human interaction in SE teams and team dynamics
  * [Oth] Any other agent in SE topics not covered in the preceding list.
