School on Symbolic and Statistical Methods for Reasoning and Processing
Formal Expressions
Kutaisi International University, Kutaisi, Georgia
July 7th-11th 2025  (https://europroofnet.github.io/Kutaisi25/)

The School on Symbolic and Statistical Methods for Reasoning and Processing
Formal Expressions aims to equip participants with advanced techniques for
formal reasoning and expression processing. Covering topics such as access
control policies, symbolic knowledge extraction, automated protocol
analysis, and quantitative constraint solving, the program bridges symbolic
and statistical approaches. It explores the integration of regular
languages in deep learning and the use of runtime verification with SMT
solving, providing both theoretical foundations and practical applications.
Through interdisciplinary learning, the school fosters research and
innovation in formal methods and AI.
