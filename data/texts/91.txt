Dear colleagues,

I have openings for postdocs to join my group. 
Possible topics include AI to reason about and modify software (e.g., 
LLM agents for finding and fixing bugs), static and dynamic program 
analysis (e.g., to infer specifications), and test input generation 
(e.g., to compare the behavior of old and new code via differential 
testing).

Please see https://software-lab.org/ for details and how to apply.

The positions will be at CISPA, are fully funded, and will be filled as 
soon as possible. The work place is Stuttgart, Germany.

For any questions, please contact:

Best,
Michael
