﻿48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Call for Workshops

The workshops at the International Conference on Software Engineering 2026
(ICSE) provide a forum for groups of 20-50 participants to discuss topics
in software engineering research and practice. ICSE Workshops can be quite
diverse. They serve as incubators for scientific communities that form and
share a particular research agenda. They also provide opportunities for
researchers to exchange and discuss scientific and engineering ideas at an
early stage, before they have matured to warrant conference or journal
publication.

Workshops at ICSE 2026 will be held between Sunday, April 12, and Tuesday,
April 14, or Saturday, April 18, 2026, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In
general, participation in ICSE workshops is open. The workshop papers will
be published by the *ACM*.

*NOTE: Novelties introduced in this call are highlighted in bold.*
Submissions
<https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2026/icse-2026-workshops#submissions>

All proposals must not exceed 5 pages, including a maximum of 4 pages for
the proposal text, references, appendices and figures, plus 1 page for the
draft Call for Submissions.

Submissions of workshops should be in pdf format, 12 point font. Since the
workshop submissions will not be published (they will only be used to
gather information to decide about acceptance, and to enable advertising
your workshop), they do not need to adhere strictly to the *ACM style*.

The main body (max 4 pages) of each proposal must include the following
information, in the order specified:

   1. Workshop Title *and Acronym*
   2. Abstract (200 words or fewer), suited for the ICSE 2026 website
   3. Contact Information for all workshop organizers, including the main
   contact person
   4. Motivation and Objectives
      - Relevance of the workshop to the field of software engineering.
      - Anticipated goals and outcomes (e.g., open research problems to
      pursue, validation objectives, empirical studies).
   5. Format and Required Services
      - Workshop format (e.g., paper presentations, keynotes, breakout
      sessions, panel-like discussions) and plans for generating discussions.
      - Intended length (1 or 2 days) and preferred dates (before or after
      the main ICSE 2026 conference).
      - Special services, logistic and/or equipment constraints.
   6. Target Audience
      - Expected background of the workshop attendees.
      - Plans regarding the mix of industry and research participation.
      - Expected minimum and maximum number of workshop participants.
      - Plans for soliciting and selecting workshop participants, including
      whether the workshop will be open or closed (in case of a closed
workshop,
      provide a justification).
   7. Proceedings
      - Types of contributions (position papers, research papers, short
      papers etc. + *MANDATORY “extended abstracts”*) and their estimated
      number and page limits. *NOTE: Workshops must include an option for
      submission of “extended abstracts” (limited to five pages or
less) and make
      it explicit that those are free of APC charges. However, for them to be
      free, the “extended abstract” term should be explicit in the call (and
      papers should be marked as such by the proceedings chairs). Please note
      that “short papers” are charged, but “extended abstracts” are not
      (see https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/article-types
      <https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/article-types>).*
      - Review and evaluation process to decide about the acceptance of
      submissions.
      - Program committee, including tentative and already committed
      members.
      - Link to the preliminary website of the workshop.
      - A proceeding chair, who will be responsible to send the list of
      accepted papers (paper titles, authors, emails) to the publishers.
   8. Workshop History
      - Number of registered attendees and websites of previous editions of
      the workshop (if any).
   9. Organizers’ bios
      - A brief description of each organizer’s background, including
      relevant past experience in organizing conferences and workshops.

Proposal Review Criteria
<https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2026/icse-2026-workshops#proposal-review-criteria>

ICSE welcomes long-running, successful workshops. Therefore, the chairs may
desk-accept proposals for workshops that have had at least 20 participants,
on average, over at prior two years’ instances of that workshop, *but such
proposals must be submitted via HotCRP for appreciation*. Proposals for new
workshops should carefully consider existing workshops and co-located
events to avoid duplication or significant overlaps as these may be
desk-rejected. All other proposals that meet the basic requirements
identified in the call will be evaluated by at least three members of the
program committee. The chairs reserve the right to request the PC to
evaluate any proposal in this manner.
For Accepted Workshops
<https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2026/icse-2026-workshops#for-accepted-workshops>

For all accepted workshops, ICSE 2026 requires uniform deadlines for
workshop papers submission, notification of authors, and camera-ready
copies, as described in the Important Dates below. *All accepted workshops
must use the HotCRP online submission system (to be provided by the ICSE
Organizing Team after proposal notification).*Moreover, papers must have a
maximum length of 8 pages and all *calls for workshop papers must
explicitly inform and allow submission of “extended abstracts” (up to five
pages), considering ACM Open policies: ACM papers, excluding “extended
abstracts”, need to have an OA institutional agreement or undergo article
processing charges (APCs) to be paid by the authors (250 dollars for
members, and 350 for non-members) in order to be published.* It is not
possible to pay for extra pages. For workshops that will opt for
publication in *ACM* prior to the event, the call for submissions must
include the following statement:

“The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the
proceedings are made available by *ACM*. This date may be up to two weeks
prior to the first day of ICSE 2026. The official publication date affects
the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.”

Conditions
<https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2026/icse-2026-workshops#conditions>

ICSE 2026 is not able to pay for registration, travel, or other
arrangements for workshop organizers. ICSE 2026 will also not pay for
workshop dinners. Additionally, ICSE 2026 cannot guarantee to honor
specific requests for holding the workshop on specific dates. All
participants, including workshop organizers, keynote speakers, and invited
guests, must register for the workshop. One keynote speaker per workshop
can benefit from a free workshop registration (note that the free
registration only includes the workshop, and none of the other events are
included; for instance, the main conference is not included in the free
workshop registration). Workshop organizers cannot submit (refereed) papers
to their own workshop. This restriction extends to workshop organizer’s
currently directly supervised students, even if the particular submitted
work does not include the workshop organizer.
