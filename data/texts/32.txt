The 22nd International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes
(MPLR, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting
and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages
and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most
important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and
real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms)
and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).

#### Topics

The areas of interest include but are not limited to:

- Languages and Compilers
    - Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, Lua, MATLAB, Raku, Pony, …)
    - Domain-specific languages
    - Language design
    - Compilers and interpreters
    - Type systems and program logics
    - Language interoperability
    - Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency

- Virtual Machines
    - Portable intermediate representations (e.g., JVM, WebAssembly, RPython, ...)
    - Managed runtime systems (e.g., GraalVM, Android Runtime (ART), V8, JavaScriptCore, .NET, …)
    - VM design and optimization
    - VMs for mobile and embedded devices
    - VMs for real-time applications
    - Memory management and garbage collection
    - Hardware/software co-design
    - Persistence

- Techniques, Tools, and Applications
    - Static and dynamic program analysis
    - Testing and debugging
    - Refactoring
    - Program understanding
    - Program synthesis
    - Security and privacy
    - Performance analysis and monitoring
    - Compiler and program verification and model checking

If you are unsure whether a particular topic falls within the scope of MPLR
'25 or if you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact the
Program Chair Tomoharu Ugawa at ugawa ci i u-tokyo ac jp.

#### Submission Categories

MPLR accepts three types of submissions:

Regular research papers:

  describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms.
  Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty,
  technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art.
  Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix


Work-in-progress research papers:

  describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity
  than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an
  emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical
  rigor and experimental results.
  Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix
 Industry and tool papers:

  presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language
  platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry
  and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and
  results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be
  considered for tool papers.
  Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix;
          up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content

Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if
the authors prefer not to be included.

MPLR 2025 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication
and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. See
http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication

MPLR 2025 will not hold its own poster session. Please consider submitting to the SPLASH poster track.

#### Author Instructions

Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the `sigplan` style.

If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the `acmart` document class
with the `sigplan` option (*not* the `sigconf` option). In the
`acmart-primary.zip` file that downloads from the LaTeX (Version 1.90) link
on the https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template page, look for
`samples/sample-sigplan.tex` as a guide. If you use Overleaf, be sure to
change the `documentclass` option `manuscript` to `sigplan`. For ease of
reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using the LaTeX
command `\settopmatter{printfolios=true}`. Please use the standard setting,
e.g., the default font size for the SIGPLAN style is 10 point and the format
uses two columns for the test.

All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind
reviewing. Authors should not show their names on a submission and should
refer to their own work in third person.** We further recommend that they
avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while
it is under review.

Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black
and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct
and font sizes are legible.
