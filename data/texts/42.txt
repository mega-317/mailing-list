Dear ontology-engineering enthusiast,
We draw your immediate attention to this call: The submission deadline of all JOWO workshops has been extended to June 14th, 2025, which means you still have roughly two weeks to finish that report, idea, result, vision, or model that you have been working on. Time to get to work(shops)!

Don’t hesitate, even a small idea can have huge impact. The workshops offer you a chance to plant the small seed that may or may not become the intellectual oak of the future, standing tall, or a delicate bonsai tree, small but oh-so important in the forest of science. A twenty page document titled “Information Management: A proposal” started as an intriguing proposal for a one-year project, and ended being the birth certificate of the internet, signed by one Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Had he not shared his idea with his community at CERN, we would not have been able to send you this e-mail. In this light, what will we miss if you do not share your ideas? Take this chance, we welcome your work within the communities of Joint Ontologies Workshops (JOWO).'
