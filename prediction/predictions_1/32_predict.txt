### 1. [SCOPE & IDENTITY]
- The 22nd International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).

### 2. [TIMELINE & DATES]
- [MPLR 2025] Paper Submission Deadline: June 24, 2025 (extended)

### 3. [ACTIONABLE REQUIREMENTS]
- [MPLR 2025] Regular research papers: describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix.
  
- [MPLR 2025] Work-in-progress research papers: describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix.

- [MPLR 2025] Industry and tool papers: presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered for tool papers. Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content.

- [MPLR 2025] Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the `sigplan` style. All submissions need to be in PDF format.
