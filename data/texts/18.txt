Dear colleagues,

(Please forward this to high-profile candidates looking for a permanent position at a top university at the heart of Europe)

The Computer Science department at UCLouvain (Belgium) will soon open three full-time faculty positions targeting excellent profiles in the following domains:

- Positions 1 and 2, in one or more of these areas:
=> Software engineering,
=> Programming systems and languages,
=> Software dependability, including formal methods.

- Position 3, in software security and cybersecurity, also broadly construed (e.g., system security, cyber-physical systems security, AI for security & security for AI, privacy, distributed systems security, etc.).

The three positions will be open to all seniority levels (assistant/associate or full).

Highlights:

We expect vacancies to be announced on the UCLouvain job portal [1] in early September, with a deadline a few weeks later for a standard application package (resume, teaching/research statement, etc.). Applications will only be accepted on the UCLouvain job portal. Pending this official publication, however, interested potential candidates are welcome to contact the department chair at [log in to unmask]<mailto:[log in to unmask]> with any questions.
