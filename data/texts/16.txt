Call for Papers for the First Submission Round of 

EICS 2026: The 18th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive
Computing Systems, June 22-26, 2025 - Trier, Germany

Submission deadline for the 1st Round of PACM EICS 2026 for Full Papers and
Technical Notes: July 25, 2025

 

EICS 2026 is the eighteenth international ACM SIGCHI conference devoted to
engineering interactive computing systems and their user interfaces,
addressing one or more software quality factors, such as usability, user
experience, reliability, security, etc. Work presented at EICS covers all
stages of the engineering life-cycle of interactive systems - inception,
requirements, design, specification, coding, data analytics, validation and
verification, deployment and maintenance.

 

EICS has the longest tradition of bringing together researchers who
contribute to better ways of creating interactive computing systems,
stemming from the conference on command languages in the seventies. The
conference is best known for rigorously contributing and disseminating
research results that hold the midst in between user interface design,
software engineering and computational interaction.

 

EICS focuses on models, languages, notations, methods, techniques and tools
that support designing, developing, validating and verifying interactive
systems. The conference brings together people who study or practice the
engineering of interactive systems, drawing from design, HCI, software
engineering, requirements engineering, software development, modeling, and
programming.

 

Submissions advance the state of the art of the engineering of interactive
systems. Topics include, but are not limited to:

 

*Modelling, specification and analysis of interaction and interactive
systems

*Requirements engineering for interactive systems

*Methods, processes, principles and/or tools for building interactive
systems (e.g., design, implementation, prototyping, evaluation, verification
and validation, testing)

*Software architectures for interactive systems

*Formal methods within interactive systems engineering

*Bridging the gap between engineering and design practices.

*Engineering design and evaluation tools

*Computational techniques for designing and evaluating interactive systems

*Interactive data-driven systems

*Explore and/or employ of diverse interaction techniques and devices (e.g.,
adaptive, context-aware, tangible, haptic, touch and multitouch input,
voice, gestures, recognition of physiological signals, multimodal input,
mobile and wearable systems, virtual, augmented, mixed and extended reality)

*Engineering hardware or software integration in interactive systems (e.g.,
fabrication and maker processes, physical computing, cyber-physical systems)

*Engineering interactive systems for diverse user groups (e.g., children,
elderly, people with disabilities…)

*Engineering collaborative multi-user interactive systems

*Engineering interactive systems embedding AI-technologies

*Engineering interaction-driven AI-technologies 

*Applying AI technologies in methods, processes and tools for building
interactive systems in all stages of the engineering lifecycle

FULL PAPERS and TECHNICAL NOTES SUBMISSIONS

 

EICS Full Papers and Technical Notes are published as articles in the
Journal Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACM - EICS
series). There are three submission deadlines per year, and authors can
choose when to submit. Papers follow the traditional journal model of
reviewing: papers may be accepted after submission and review, or may be
recommended for revisions and re-submission to the next round to enable
authors to refine papers based on reviewer recommendations.

 

Submissions for the journal of this venue should present original and mature
research work within the scope of the conference. Note that accepted journal
papers can be either regular research papers, or technical notes. Technical
Notes are shorter, more focused contributions, that focus specifically on
system contributions and technical work. Elucidating technical details of
complex interactive systems, preferably ensuring the work can be reproduced
or put to practice, is a primary objective of a Technical Note. Tech Notes
require an illustrative example of the system, and they can, but do not need
to, be validated by formal user evaluations or user studies. Validation can
also be done through e.g. simulation, feasibility, or comparisons. Tech
Notes will be judged on their technical merits and relevance to interactive
systems concerns.

 

There are no length restrictions on Full Papers and Technical Notes, nor any
limit to the number of references that may be included. We advise authors to
ensure the length of their papers is in function of the contributions.
Concise and clear is often to be preferred over lengthy and verbose.

 

Full Papers and Technical Notes should be written in the ACM format, see
https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions 

 

Papers should comply with the ACM policy on Research Involving Human
Participants and Subjects, see
