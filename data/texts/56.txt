Open Positions for

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHER in MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING

at the Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria.

starting any time (ideally in 2025).



Vision

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to explore model-driven,
structured engineering. Our work emphasis on tracking model changes rather
than model states (e.g., files or snapshots). This improves our
understanding of engineering history and enables advanced services such as
collaborative modeling, live constraint checking, and conflict detection.
This research lies at the intersection of modeling, version control, and
scalable software infrastructure, with strong applications in software and
systems engineering. More details about our work can be found here:

https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-software-systems-engineering/research/tools/designspace/

The successful candidate will gain comprehensive experiences in all key
areas of postdoctoral training, including:

- Supervision and mentoring of doctoral and other students

- Leading and supporting publications in high-impact venues

- Designing and conducting experimental and empirical studies

- Contributing to grant writing and research proposal development

- Overseeing and guiding software development efforts

- Connecting the dots between various student works to push the bigger
picture

- Teaching responsibilities (equivalent to 4 semester hours per week)



Candidate Profile

We are looking for a post-doctoral researcher who has the desire to make a
strong impact on software engineering and model-driven engineering. The
candidate should already have published in conferences or journals. The
primary evaluation criterion is excellence:

The successful candidate must:

- hold a Doctorate/Ph.D. degree in Informatics or a related academic area

- have a strong command of English

- have excellent programming skills

German language skills are not required.



Duration and Salary

The selected candidate will be appointed to a full-time position with an
initial term of 3-4 years. An annual performance evaluation will be
conducted each year. Subject to mutual agreement, the position may be
extended beyond the initial term. The gross annual salary is €69,000.
Austria offers a relatively affordable cost of living, and low-cost housing
options for university employees may be available, depending on
availability.



Topics of Interest

The postdoc position is only partially funded by a specific agency,
allowing for considerable flexibility in the choice of research topics. Our
group has a strong reputation in areas such as traceability, consistency
and repair, change propagation, collaborative engineering, co-evolution,
and variability. Additionally, there is significant local industry interest
in addressing the broader challenges of developing software-intensive
systems, particularly in the context of hardware/software co-modeling.



University Profile

The research will be conducted in Linz, Austria—a vibrant city located just
north of the Alps. Linz offers a high quality of life and is known for
being safe, clean, and healthy. Nearby Vienna has repeatedly been ranked
the world’s most livable city, thanks in large part to the region’s
welcoming atmosphere and well-balanced environment.



Group Profile

Our research group at the Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria
consists of a dynamic, multi-national staff of researchers.

https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-software-systems-engineering/about-us/team/

The working language of the institute is English. Our team includes
internationally recognized scholars in software engineering, with accolades
such as recognition in Communications of the ACM (2007) and Springer
Scientometrics (May 2014), best paper awards, and Recognition of Service
awards. We consistently publish in leading conferences (ICSE, MODELS, ICSME
or ASE) and journals, including IEEE TSE, JSS, IST, or SoSyM. Notably, many
of our former postdoctoral researchers have gone on to secure prestigious
professorships worldwide.



How to Apply

Applications, including a detailed curriculum vitae (in English), should be
sent to Prof. Alexander Egyed ([log in to unmask]). Please include a
one page description of your research interests and how it connects to our
work.



We are looking forward to hearing from you!
