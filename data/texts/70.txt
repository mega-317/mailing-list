## About SBMF

SBMF 2025 is the twenty-eighth in a series of events devoted to the
development, dissemination, and use of formal methods for the construction
of high-quality computational systems. It is now a well-established event
with an international reputation. It regularly receives submissions and
participants from all over the world.

## Submission Guidelines

We invite submissions of papers with a strong emphasis on formal methods,
whether practical or theoretical, in the following categories:

 - Regular papers (limit of 15 pages). Proofs of theoretical results that
 do not fit the page limit may be provided in an appendix.

 - Short papers (limit of 8 pages). Short papers include system
 descriptions, user experiences, and case studies. We encourage authors to
 make the data needed to reproduce their experiments available.

The page limits exclude references and appendices.

Contributions should not be simultaneously submitted for publication
elsewhere. They should be written in English and prepared using Springer’s
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format. Springer’s proceedings
LaTeX templates are available in Overleaf. More information is available at
the following link:
https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines

Papers should present unpublished and original work that has a clear
contribution to the state-of-the-art on the theory and practice of formal
methods. Papers will be judged by at least three reviewers based on
originality, relevance, technical soundness, and presentation quality and
should contain sound theoretical or practical results. Industry papers
should emphasize the practical application of formal methods or report on
open challenges.

## Scope and Topics

SBMF aims to provide a venue for the presentation and discussion of
high-quality work in formal methods. The topics include, but are not
limited to, the following:

 * Applications of formal methods to
 - Software or hardware design
 - Software or hardware development
 - Software or hardware code generation
 - Software or hardware testing
 - Software maintenance, evolution and reuse
 - Intelligent systems

 * Specification and modeling languages
 - Logic and semantics for specification and programming languages
 - Formal methods for timed, real-time, hybrid, or safety-critical systems
 - Formal methods for service-oriented, cloud-based, or cyber-physical
systems

 * Theoretical foundations
 - Domain theory
 - Term rewriting
 - Computational models
 - Type systems and category systems
 - Computation complexity of methods and models
 - Models of time, concurrency, security, and mobility

 * Verification and validation
 - Abstraction, modularization, and refinement techniques
 - Static analysis
 - Model checking
 - Theorem proving
 - Software certification
 - Correctness by construction

 * Experience reports
 - Reports on teaching formal methods
 - Reports on the industrial application of formal methods

## Publication

Accepted papers will be published, after the conference, in a volume of
LNCS. The authors will be requested to complete and sign a
consent-to-publish form. Every accepted paper MUST have at least one author
registered in the symposium by the time the camera-ready copy is submitted.
The registered author is also expected to attend the symposium and present
the paper.

**To be confirmed:** We plan to follow on last years' tradition of
organizing
a special issue of the Science of Computer Programming Journal (Elsevier)
with selected and extended papers from the 28th Brazilian Symposium on
Formal
Methods (SBMF 2025).
