CALL FOR APPLICATIONS

ERCIM STM WG 2025 Award for the

Best Ph.D. Thesis on Security and Trust Management

 =======================================================================

The European Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM) 
has a technical WG on Security and Trust Management (STM) for performing 
a series of activities, as research projects, workshop/conference 
organization, dissemination of knowledge, for increasing the European 
research and development capabilities on security, trust, and privacy. 
One of the main goals of the WG is to promote the scientific growth of 
young researchers interested in the field of security and trust 
management. ERCIM STM WG then decided to establish an award for the best 
Ph.D. thesis in this area to increase the visibility of the young 
researchers within the ERCIM scientific community as well as in the 
scientific community in general.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* applied cryptography;
* data and application security;
* identity management;
* networked systems security;
* privacy, anonymity, and untraceability;
* rigorous semantics and computational models for security and trust;
* security, privacy, and trust in emerging computing paradigms;
* security and trust management architectures, mechanisms, and policies.

Applications for the award in 2025 are open to all Ph.D. holders that 
defended their thesis during 2024 in any European University. 
Applications consisting of the Ph.D. Thesis (in PDF format), a short 
summary of the Thesis (mandatory in English), a curriculum vitae (in PDF 
format), and letters of support from at least two researchers, one of 
whom should be from an ERCIM STM WG Institution, should be sent by July 
31, 2025 to [log in to unmask] (Cristina Alcaraz). Please use "ERCIM STM PhD 
Award 2025 -- Application" as subject of the message.

Theses will be evaluated by a Committee appointed from the European 
research community. The theses will be judged on the basis of scientific 
quality, originality, clarity of presentation, as well as potential 
impact of the results.

The ceremony for the award will be held during the 21st International 
Workshop on Security and Trust Management (STM 2025) on September 25-26, 
2025 in Toulouse, France (https://www.nics.uma.es/stm2025/).
