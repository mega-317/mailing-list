SDS 2025

In the era of digital transformation, the world is rapidly converging
toward a future where *everything will be software-controlled*. From
networks and infrastructure to industry, cities, and devices, the shift
toward *softwarisation* is redefining how systems are built, operated, and
evolved. This paradigm enables unprecedented agility, automation, and
intelligence across every layer of modern computing environments. *The 12th
International Conference on Software Defined Systems (SDS 2025)* invites
researchers, engineers, and practitioners from academia, industry, and
government to explore the foundations, architectures, challenges, and
breakthroughs in software-defined everything. The conference serves as a
multidisciplinary platform to showcase innovations in *programmability,
abstraction, virtualization, and orchestration* that drive software-defined
solutions across domains. As control and intelligence increasingly migrate
from hardware to software, SDS 2025 aims to stimulate cross-disciplinary
dialogue and foster collaborations that bridge networking, systems,
security, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and beyond. SDS 2025 is
more than a conference, it's a forum to define the software-driven future
of connected intelligence. We welcome theoretical insights, practical
innovations, case studies, and visionary ideas that push the boundaries of
software-defined systems.

We welcome high-quality research and case studies in, but not limited to,
the following areas:
