Hello,

I am an assistant professor at NUS, and I am excited to announce the following
postdoctoral position. Please share this post (available at
https://michaeldadams.org/hiring) with anyone who you think might be interested.

## Postdoctoral Position Available in Programming Languages Working on
Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming

We are excited to announce a postdoctoral position in programming languages
focused on the newly emerging paradigm of fixed-point-oriented programming. This
paradigm allows for the development of programs based on inference rules that
traverse a lattice, significantly simplifying complex algorithms in areas such
as parsing, static analysis, type-checking, graph algorithms, and automata
minimization.

### Position Details:

- Application Process: If you or someone you know is interested in this
position, please email me at "adamsmd AT nus.edu.sg" to schedule a Zoom
interview. We are eager to fill this role quickly, so interviews will begin
immediately, and we encourage you to reach out promptly to ensure your
application is considered before the position is filled.

- Duration and Salary: The position offers a competitive salary and a
flexible start date, with funding available for 2 to 3 years, contingent upon
satisfactory progress.

### About the Project:

Fixed-point oriented programming is an emerging programming paradigm that lets
one write programs in terms of inference rules that climb a lattice. While that
might sound like obscure theory, in practice, it greatly simplifies many complex
algorithms in domains such as parsing, static analysis, type checking, graph
algorithms, and automata minimization. In fact, using this framework, many
classic algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, CYK parsing, Hopcroft's
automata minimization algorithm, and tree-automata minimization can be expressed
in only two or three executable lines of code.

Our team is developing a language and implementation that transforms high-level
specifications into optimized Haskell modules, similar to how parser generators,
SQL engines, or SMT solvers streamline tasks in their respective domains. Key
components of this project will involve language design, compiler development,
and the development of sophisticated code optimization techniques.

### About Me and My Research:

My research is dedicated to empowering programmers to write clear, concise, and
elegant code without compromising performance. My work encompasses
next-generation languages, compilers, optimization, domain-specific and
extensible languages, generic and meta-programming, duality, syntax and parsing,
and static analysis/control-flow analysis.
