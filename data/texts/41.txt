ETAPS, established in 1998, is a confederation of four annual conferences accompanied by satellite workshops. ETAPS 2026 is the twenty-nineth event in the series.   -- Why choose ETAPS? --  * ETAPS is one of the world's leading fora for research on software science,   with a history of more than 25 years. * The proceedings of ETAPS appear in gold open access, with no article   processing charge f
 or the authors specifically. * All constituent conferences provide artifact evaluation (AE). * In addition to the conference, ETAPS also unites the software science   community with activities such as a blog on software science, a PhD   workshop, sessions on diversity and inclusion and an ask-me-anything session. * Poster and Tool demo sessions are organized over the week. * Spin Symposium and Rust Verification Workshop are colocated with ETAPS again.   -- What is new in 2026? --  * Submission deadlines are strict and firm, no exceptions will be granted.  * FoSSaCS 2026 will adopt a double-blind reviewing process, in line with the   other ETAPS conferences.  * Program Committee (PC) members of FoSSaCS will be allowed to submit up to one   paper to FoSSaCS. These submissions will be held to a higher acceptance   threshold - for example, PC submissions will not be part of the final vote.   -- MAIN CONFERENCES (April 13-16, 2026) --  * ESOP: European Symposium on Programming     (PC ch
 air: Robbert Krebbers, Radboud University;      AE chair: Michael Sammler, ISTA) * FASE: Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering     (PC chairs: Elvira Albert, Complutense University of Madrid,                 Corina Pasareanu, NASA Ames;      AE chair: TBD) * FoSSaCS: Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures     (PC chairs: Nathalie Bertrand, Rennes University,                 Stefan Milius, Friedrich-Alexander Universitaet;      AE chair: Guillermo Alberto Perez, University of Antwerp) * TACAS: Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems     (PC chairs: Sebastian Junges, Radboud University,                 Guy Katz, Hebrew University;      AE chairs: Guy Amir, Cornell University,                 Matthias Volk, Eindhoven University of Technology)  -- IMPORTANT DATES --  * Submission deadline ESOP round 1: June 3, 2025 * Rebuttal ESOP round 1: July 21-23, 2025 * Notification ESOP round 1: August 1, 2025 * Submission deadline for ESOP ro
 und 2: October 16, 2025 * Submission deadline for TACAS, FoSSaCS, FASE: October 16, 2025 * TACAS mandatory artifact submission deadline (for tools): October 30, 2025 * Rebuttal (ESOP, FoSSaCS, TACAS): December 8-10, 2025 * Paper notification and TACAS mandatory artifact notification:     December 22, 2025 * Artifact submission deadline for accepted deadline (except for TACAS tools):     January 8, 2026 * Paper final version:     January 22, 2026 * Artifact notification ESOP, FASE, FoSSaCS, TACAS (voluntary artifacts):     February 12, 2026  * Main Conference: April 13-16, 2026   -- PUBLICATION --  The proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research in Computing and Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of Springer's LNCS series. The proceedings volumes will appear in gold open access, so the published versions of all papers will be available for everyone to download from the publisher's website freely from the date of online publication, perpetually. The copyright of the papers w
 ill remain with the authors.   -- AWARDS --  The strongest papers from the four conferences will be marked as distinguished papers and highlighted in the conference program. From these distinguished papers, the EAPLS, EASST, and EATCS, and the Best Tool Paper Award committees will select the best ETAPS papers.  The ETAPS Test-of-Time Award will be granted, recognizing outstanding papers published at ETAPS more than ten years in the past.  The ETAPS Rance Cleaveland Test-of-Time Tool Award acknowledges the importance of reliable and well-maintained research tools and the significant effort that their creation and maintenance entails.  The Doctoral Dissertation Award will be granted to promote and recognize an outstanding dissertation in the research areas covered by the four main ETAPS conferences.   -- SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS --  The four main conferences of ETAPS 2026 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given *excluding the bibliography*.  * ESOP: regu
 lar research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max   15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming   languages and systems of max 15 pp.    For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in   other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to   https://etaps.org/2026/esop for more details. * FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp;   new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp;   tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp    (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp).  * FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp. * TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of   max 16 pp, tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp.  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions, where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedin
 gs and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2026 as an on-site conference.  Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer's LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) - except for ESOP, see above - and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  ETAPS conferences will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS, only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third p
 erson, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  ESOP, TACAS and FoSSaCS will use an **author rebuttal phase**.   -- ARTIFACT SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION --  Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper's acceptance decision.  For research paper and case study paper submissions at TACAS, participation in artifact evaluation is voluntary. Authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will not change the paper acceptance decision.  ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however, participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  For ES
 OP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.   -- SATELLITE EVENTS (April 11-12, 2026) --  Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.   -- CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION --  ETAPS 2026 will take place in Turin, Italy and is organized by the University of Turin. The Department of Computer Science at the University of Turin is the centre coordinating research, teaching, dissemination and technological transfer in Computer Science. The Department covers both methodological and application oriented aspects of computer science, and performs research in several interdisciplinary areas. This reflects in the collaborations with other research centres and companies in many scientific areas and in its participation in n
 ational and European projects. With a fascinating history and a beautiful historic center, Turin is a delightful city for a visit. It is a city in constant evolution: from Augusta Taurinorum (after 27 a.C.) to the capital of the Savoy Dukedom (1563) until becoming Italy's first capital (1861), the queen of the automobile industry (1899) and the star of the 2006 Winter Olympics. The city is now better known for excellent regional food, beautiful squares & architecture, and as a technology hub with a strong start-up community.  The long list of world-class monuments, galleries and museums includes: the Egyptian Museum, the Museum of Oriental Art, the Automobile Museum and the National Cinema Museum, located at the stunning Mole Antonelliana.
