        "description": "Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as a key approach to understand, monitor, and improve systems across various domains including agriculture, automotive, avionics, construction, healthcare, manufacturing, and smart cities. DT development is inherently multi-disciplinary and requires the integration of data, models, simulation, software engineering, and domain knowledge. Despite increasing adoption, DT engineering is still often ad hoc, lacking systematic concepts, methods, and tools. EDTconf 2025 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to shape the future of engineering DTs in a systematic, scalable, and principled way.",
