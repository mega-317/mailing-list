      "introduction": "In recent years, the widespread integration of machine learning and deep learning models into real-world applications across various domains has exposed numerous operational challenges in model building, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a key approach to addressing these challenges. It encompasses practices and tools designed to streamline the entire ML lifecycle, with a focus on end-to-end automation, reproducibility, and scalability of ML workflows.",
      "goals": "This workshop encourages discussions on bridging the gap between data science experimentation and the reliable operation of ML components in production. We invite submissions that address the open challenges, latest breakthroughs, and practical use cases in the rapidly evolving field of MLOps. By bringing together researchers and practitioners, the workshop aims to foster the exchange of valuable insights and advancements from both academia and industry.",
