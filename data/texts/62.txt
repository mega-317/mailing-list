29th ETAPS International Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
Torino, Italy, April 11–16, 2026

# About ETAPS
The ETAPS International Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software is
the primary forum for academic and industrial researchers working on topics
relating to Software Science. It has been an annual event held each spring
since 1998. Its 29th edition, ETAPS 2026, will be held on April 11–16, 2026,
in Torino, Italy.

The ETAPS 2026 main conferences, scheduled for April 13–16, are:

* ESOP: European Symposium on Programming
* FASE: Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering
* FoSSaCS: Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures
* TACAS: Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems

The ETAPS 2026 satellite events will be held on Saturday and Sunday,
April 11–12, 2026.


## Call for Satellite Events

The ETAPS 2026 organizing committee invites proposals for satellite events
(e.g., workshops) to complement the main conferences. They should fall within
the scope of ETAPS.

Satellite events provide an opportunity to discuss and report on emerging
research approaches and practical experiences relevant to the theory and
practice of software.


## Important Dates

* Deadline for proposals of satellite events: June 26, 2025
* Notification of acceptance: July 9, 2025


## Arrangements for Satellite Events

The organizers of an ETAPS 2026 satellite event are expected to:

- create and maintain a website for the event
- form a PC and produce a call for papers for the event (if appropriate)
- advertise the event through mailing lists etc. to complement the publicity of
  ETAPS
- review submissions and make acceptance decisions
- prepare informal (pre-)proceedings for the event, if appropriate
- prepare the event's program according to the overall schedule of ETAPS 2026
- prepare and organize the publication of formal (post-)proceedings, if desired

The ETAPS 2026 organizing committee will:

- promote the event on the website and in the publicity material of ETAPS 2026
- arrange registration for the event as a component of registration for ETAPS
- collect a participation fee from the registrants
- provide a meeting room of appropriate size, A/V equipment, coffee breaks, and
  possibly lunch(es)

As a rule, ETAPS will not contribute toward the travel or accommodation costs
of invited speakers or organizers of satellite events.

Researchers and practitioners wishing to organize a satellite event are invited
to submit their proposal to the Satellite Events Chairs:

- Vincenzo Ciancia (CNR-ISTI, Pisa, Italy)
- Luca Paolini (University of Torino, Torino, Italy)
- Enrico Beraldo (Synesthesia, Torino, Italy)

using the online application form at https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/ETAPS/ 

The following information is requested:

- the name and acronym of the satellite event
- the names and contact information of the organizers
- the duration of the event (one or two days) and the preferred period
  (April 11 / April 12 / April 11–12)
- the expected number of participants
- a brief description (120 words approximately) of the event topic for the
  website and publicity material of ETAPS 2026
- a brief explanation of the event topic and its relevance to ETAPS
- a brief description of the organizer's background, including relevant
  experience in organizing workshops and contact information.

  speakers, demo sessions, special space and equipment requirements, etc.
- a tentative schedule for paper submission, notification of acceptance, and
  final versions for the (informal pre-)proceedings (the ETAPS 2026 organizing
  committee will need the final files by January 15, 2026)
- the plans for formal publication (no formal publication, formal proceedings
  ready by the event, formal post-proceedings, publication venue – EPTCS or
  elsewhere)

Proposals will be evaluated by the ETAPS 2026 organizing committee based on
their assessed benefit for prospective participants of ETAPS 2026. We invite
prospective organizers to consult the websites of previous satellite events as
