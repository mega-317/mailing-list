--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 19th edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial
Intelligence

                      1-5 September 2025, Kutaisi, Georgia
                      https://viam.science.tsu.ge/jelia2025/
                     Call for Workshop and Tutorial Proposals
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The organizers of the JELIA conference are now inviting proposals for
affiliated workshops and tutorials. We welcome submissions on any topic
related to Artificial Intelligence.

Workshops typically provide a forum for presenting ongoing research that is
not yet ready for formal publication, while tutorials may, for example,
offer in-depth introductions to specific topics or extended demonstrations
of software tools.

We are especially interested in workshops that explore the intersection of
statistical and symbolic AI—a rapidly growing area of research that seeks
to combine the strengths of data-driven machine learning approaches with
the rigor, structure, and interpretability of logic-based reasoning. We
particularly encourage proposals that aim to bridge communities and foster
dialogue between researchers working in machine learning, knowledge
representation, logic, and cognitive systems, in line with JELIA’s
longstanding mission to promote foundational and applied research in
logical aspects of AI.

If you are considering organizing a workshop or tutorial, please feel free
to reach out to me by email ([log in to unmask]) as soon as possible.
