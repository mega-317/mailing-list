* Bedir Tekinerdogan, Wageningen University, The Netherlands
* Khalil Drira, LAAS-CNRS Universit√© de Toulouse, France

Scope and Objectives
System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) is an interdisciplinary field focused on the design, management, and optimization of complex systems that operate independently yet interact to achieve shared goals. This book addresses the growing need for advanced SoSE approaches across diverse industries, including aerospace, healthcare, energy, and smart cities, by tackling both foundational principles and emerging challenges.
The book bridges theory and practice, integrating advanced frameworks with practical tools for managing the complexity, interdependencies, and dynamics of systems of systems. It explores the role of cutting-edge technologies such as AI, IoT, digital twins, and blockchain in enhancing system efficiency, resilience, and security. It also emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration, drawing from engineering, computer science, and social sciences to develop holistic solutions.

The book examines SoSE's potential to address global challenges such as climate change, urbanization, and energy sustainability while discussing ethical, social, and environmental implications. It offers actionable insights on governance, policy, and leadership for managing large-scale projects and explores domain-specific applications in defense, smart infrastructure, renewable energy, and healthcare. Finally, it looks to the future of SoSE, speculating on emerging trends like quantum computing and 6G networks, and their potential challenges and opportunities.
By uniting contributions from leading experts, this book establishes a comprehensive resource for current practices and future directions in SoSE, equipping readers to address complex engineering challenges effectively.
