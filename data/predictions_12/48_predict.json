These positions are part of a grant sponsored by Singapore's Cybersecurity Agency (CSA) under the National Cybersecurity R&D programme named 'Fuzz Testing', which is funded from 2023 to 2027. The program aims to improve the reliability of modern software applications using fuzz testing techniques and will involve research on concurrent, distributed, and stateful software, including parts of the Linux Kernel. Interested applicants should have a PhD or be submitting their PhD thesis soon and are required to submit a CV, research statement, and names of two referees. The postdoc will be located in the Computer Science Department of NUS, which has a strong academic reputation.",
