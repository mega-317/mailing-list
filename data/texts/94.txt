ER2025 Call for Papers

44th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER 2025)

20-23 October 2025, Poitiers, France
https://er2025.ensma.fr/

ER is the premier international conference for research and practice on
Conceptual Modelling. The conference provides a vibrant forum for
discussing and extending the state-of-the-art conceptual modeling
foundations, emerging and future challenges, and the pivotal role
conceptual modeling plays in a variety of applications. In celebrating its
44th anniversary this year, we especially invite contributions on the theme
of:

BUILDING TRUST THROUGH CONCEPTUAL MODELING

Building trust in digital ecosystems has gained a heightened importance in
an increasingly contested world. This year’s theme focuses on the important
role conceptual modeling plays in creating systems that are trustworthy,
inclusive, and transparent. We invite the Conceptual Modelling community to
deliberate on how traditional modeling principles and frameworks can
contribute and adapt to new advancements in AI, data ecosystems, and
autonomous platforms while upholding ethical standards and fostering trust
in digital innovations.

We welcome submissions of original research on a variety of topics on
conceptual modeling, including well-established and emerging areas of
research and practice, as well as submissions that lead to new foundations,
links, applications, or enlarge current boundaries of conceptual modeling.
We also invite industry reports and vision papers.

----------------------------------------
Submission Guidelines for Full Papers and Review Process
----------------------------------------
Since the proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series,
authors must submit manuscripts using the LNCS style (see style files and
details). Springer has provided a LaTeX template in Overleaf for your
convenience. The page limit for submitted papers (as well as for final,
camera-ready papers) is 16 pages (excluding references). ER 2025 follows a
double-blind review process. Authors are therefore asked to remove all
identifying information (self-references, acknowledgments, involved
research projects, etc.) from the manuscript and use repository
anonymization services like https://anonymous.4open.science/ to anonymize
potential source code repositories and online supplementary material.

Manuscripts not submitted in the LNCS style or exceeding the page limit
will be desk rejected. Likewise, submissions that do not primarily focus on
aspects of conceptual modeling shall be rejected without undergoing formal
reviewing. Papers submitted must not be under evaluation for or have
already been published in, or accepted for publication, in a journal or
another conference.

Each paper admitted to the review process will be reviewed by at least two
program committee members and, if positively evaluated, a third review and
a meta-review will be conducted by two additional program board members.
The selected papers will be discussed among the paper reviewers online to
conclude a decision.

Research papers will be assessed for the extent of contribution, grounding
in the literature, novelty, presentation quality, relevance, and technical
rigor. Industry reports should demonstrate the impact of conceptual
modeling in a real-world setting, arguing for the generalisability of
methods and lessons learned. Vision papers should describe an ambitious and
credible future state of conceptual modeling, articulating the need,
research plan, and potential impact of the vision.

Post-Conference Special Journal Issue
-------------------------------------
The authors of selected papers will be invited to prepare a substantially
revised and extended version of a Special Issue in Elsevier's Data &
Knowledge Engineering (JCR 2023 Impact Factor 2.7).
