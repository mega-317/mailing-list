CfP – IST Special Issue on “Next-Generation Model-Based Software Engineering with Foundation Models”

Submission Deadline: May 31, 2025
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This special issue of the Information and Software Technology journal aims to provide a venue for researchers to present insights, experiences, innovations, and solutions at the intersection of model-based software engineering and foundation models.

Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized traditional software engineering (SE), outperforming traditional AI-based systems in different tasks, e.g., code completion, code review, or automatic categorization of software artifacts. Just recently, the model-based engineering (MBE) community has been attracted by the usage of FMs to automatize different tasks, i.e., model completion, model transformation, and development of domain-specific language (DSL). This special issue solicits the application of well-founded FMs, e.g., pre trained models or large language models, to MBE and the related sub-fields such as model-driven engineering (MDE), model-driven development (MDD), and model-driven architecture (MDA). Furthermore, this issue seeks the application of MBE paradigm, technique, and tools to support the design, fine-tuning, and deployment of FMs.

All submissions will undergo a rigorous reviewing process by independent reviewers who are experts in this field. The review process will assess submissions based on several key criteria, including relevance, significance of contribution, technical quality, scholarship, potential impact, and quality of presentation.

Papers submitted to the Special Issue should present original, unpublished work, relevant to one of its topics, outlined below. Extensions of previously published material are accepted, if the extensions are substantial, and the relation to previously published material is clearly explained within the manuscript.  In line with the journal’s policy, submissions or any substantially overlapping work must not be under review or published in another journal or conference during the review process.
