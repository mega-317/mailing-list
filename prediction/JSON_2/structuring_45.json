      "description": "The School on Symbolic and Statistical Methods for Reasoning and Processing Formal Expressions aims to equip participants with advanced techniques for formal reasoning and expression processing. Covering topics such as access control policies, symbolic knowledge extraction, automated protocol analysis, and quantitative constraint solving, the program bridges symbolic and statistical approaches. It explores the integration of regular languages in deep learning and the use of runtime verification with SMT solving, providing both theoretical foundations and practical applications. Through interdisciplinary learning, the school fosters research and innovation in formal methods and AI.",
