Are you passionate about AI, software reliability, and making a real-world impact? Join us at the University of Otago as a Postdoctoral Fellow on our $1 million project:
â€šÃ„ÃºAutomating software violation detection and repair: future-proofing software reputation and skills development.â€šÃ„Ã¹

Lead CI: Associate Professor Sherlock Licorish, University of Otago 

Software errors can have serious consequencesâ€šÃ„Ã®impacting everything from space missions to critical infrastructure. With the rise of AI-generated code and the widespread reuse of publicly available code, the risk of inheriting software vulnerabilities is greater than ever.

Our project aims to:
- Develop cutting-edge, AI-inspired algorithms for software violation detection and repair
- Support New Zealand software developers in delivering reliable, secure, high-value software
- Package our solutions to upskill under-represented groups and address the tech skills shortage

If you have a background in software engineering, AI, or related fields and want to contribute to future-proofing software development, we want to hear from you!
