*[apologize for multiple postings]*

ICLP 2025, the 41st International Conference on Logic Programming, will be
held at the University of Calabria, Rende, Italy, from September 12 to
September 19, 2025.

This year, we are pleased to announce that eight workshops will be
co-located with ICLP 2025. The topics span a broad range of areas related
to logic programming (e.g., theory, implementation, environments, language
issues, alternative paradigms, applications), including cross-disciplinary
areas.

Below is the list of the accepted workshops, along with short descriptions
and links to their respective websites. For comprehensive details,
including submission procedures and important dates, please refer to the
individual workshop websites. The calls for paper submission are open.

32nd RCRA Workshop on Experimental Evaluation of Algorithms for Solving
Problems with Combinatorial Explosion (RCRA 2025)

The scope of the workshop is fostering the cross-fertilization of ideas
stemming from different areas, proposing benchmarks for new challenging
problems, comparing models and algorithms from an experimental viewpoint,
and, in general, comparing different approaches regarding efficiency,
problem modelling, and ease of development.

18th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms
(ASPOCP 2025)

Workshop on combining Answer Set Programming with Other Computing
Paradigms, such as constraint satisfaction, quantified Boolean formulas
(QBF), Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), first-order logic (FOL).

------------------------------

12th Workshop on Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP 2025)

The PLP workshop encompasses all aspects of combining logic, algorithms,
programming, and probability. Due to logic programming's strong theoretical
underpinnings, PLP is one of the more disciplined areas of probabilistic
programming. It builds upon and benefits from the large body of existing
work in logic programming, both in semantics and implementation, but also
presents new challenges to the field.

------------------------------

9th Workshop on Advances in Argumentation in Artificial Intelligence (AI³
2025)

Argumentation is the study of the processes and activities involving the
production and exchange of arguments, where arguments are attempts to
persuade someone or something by giving reasons for accepting a particular
conclusion as evident.
The goal of the workshop is to stimulate discussions and promote scientific
collaboration among researchers not only directly involved in
argumentation, but also from research fields indirectly related to
argumentation.

Third Prolog Education Workshop (PEG 2025)

The PEG workshop series is one of the initiatives of the Prolog Education
Group 2.0 (PEG 2.0), which aims to promote the use of Prolog-like computing
to make logical reasoning and trustworthy coding skills more universally
available.
PEG 2.0 builds upon a nearly 50-year history of developing educational
materials for using logic programming languages such as Prolog and ASP to
introduce children in primary and secondary schools to both logic and
computing. It also includes the insights and innovations developed for
teaching Prolog at university level in both Computing and non-Computing
courses.

------------------------------

Second Annual Workshop on Prolog Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

The PIP workshop series offers Prolog implementers and users an opportunity
to present short descriptions of features desired or not supported in all
systems that they believe would benefit other systems and are thus
candidates for PIPs. It is also a chance to become familiar and comment on
the process of PIP creation and the current PIPs.

Workshop on Logic Programming and Legal Reasoning (LPLR 2025)

Representation of legal rules and reasoning over them is a critical
application area since laws and regulations are used in almost all human
activities. Furthermore, corpora pertaining to laws and regulations are
typically complex and enormous in size, and experts are usually needed in
order to apply legal reasoning in everyday life. Thus, automating reasoning
over legal documents by means of applying logic programming can speed up a
process that is laborious and time consuming.
The aim of the workshop is to give the opportunity to legal experts and
computer scientists to present recent research results and discuss related
ideas on this particularly active area of research.

------------------------------

1st Workshop on Cognitive Architectures for Robotics: LLMs and Logic in
Action (CARLA)
CARLA aims to advance the field of intelligent robotics through the
integration of large language models (LLMs), symbolic reasoning, and logic
solvers. Addressing the demands of real-world adaptability, safety, and
complex decision-making, the workshop explores the complementary roles of
LLMs and symbolic systems. By combining the dynamic adaptability of LLMs
with the precise inferential capabilities of symbolic solvers, CARLA seeks
to promote the development of intelligent, reliable, and explainable
robotic systems capable of effective human interaction.
