        "description": "A special issue on Agentic AI in Software is planned in TOSEM in 2026, and papers are being solicited for this purpose. AI has had significant impact in SE affecting various branches in Software Engineering (SE) including coding, testing, analysis, patching, documentation, and even design. Lately with the arrival of Large Language Model (LLM) agents – the discipline of SE has seen further shifts. The autonomous deployment of tools with LLM backends gives the agents tremendous power and potential in bringing greater automation to SE tasks. At the same time, greater automation in SE tasks does not immediately mean greater productivity gains. There exists a lot of concerns around trust in the output produced by agents and the amount of manual effort needed to integrate agent workflows into software engineering workflows. Further, a software engineer's creativity is not only from their own thought - but can be triggered by interactions among team members or from feedback given in a team meeting.",
