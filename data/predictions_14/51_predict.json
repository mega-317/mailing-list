      "Workshop: 17th to 19th of November 2025",
      "We encourage submissions that are advancing the applicability of formal methods for autonomous systems, for example, improving integration or explainability, automation or knowledge transfer of these techniques; a wider discussion of these principles can be found in 'A Manifesto for Applicable Formal Methods' https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12758.",
