Applicants are invited for postdoctoral positions at the National 
University of Singapore (NUS) in the area of **fuzz testing**, please see

*https://nus-tss.github.io/fuzzing/*

These positions will be part of a grant sponsored by Singapore's 
Cybersecurity Agency (CSA) as part of National Cybersecurity R&D (NCR) 
programme named "Fuzz Testing" which has been funded 2023-2027. This is 
a large research program involving several research projects that 
improve the reliability of modern software applications using techniques 
inspired from fuzz testing.

As part of this program, we will advance the state-of-the-art in testing 
and analysis of concurrent/ distributed / stateful software, including 
kernel software such as parts of the Linux Kernel. The fuzzing works 
will go hand in hand with our works on agentic AI based automated 
program repair (_https://spartan-nus.github.io/coderover-s.html_) to 
produce an end to end solution.

The program has started 1 July 2023, and we request interested 
applicants to reach out to us early with the following information. 
Interested applicants need to have a PhD degree or should be submitting 
PhD thesis soon.

Documents required:

1. CV, including publications
2. Research statement
3. Names of two referees

The postdoc will be located in the Computer Science Department of NUS, 
which enjoys a high degree of academic reputation.

Interested applicants may reach out directly to *Abhik Roychoudhury, 
Lead PI, [log in to unmask]*
