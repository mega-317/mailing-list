The eighth edition of the Software Engineering for Machine Learning Applications (SEMLA) symposium (https://semla.polymtl.ca) will take place at Polytechnique Montréal, Montréal, Canada, from June 17 to June 19, 2025. We have an exciting program featuring world-renowned researchers and practitioners.

SEMLA brings together leading experts in software engineering and machine learning to discuss the challenges of developing complex data-intensive software systems. We invite practitioners and researchers from all related fields to participate.

The theme of SEMLA 2025 is AgentOps and Intelligent Systems, focusing on two transformative areas:

**AgentOps: The operationalization of intelligent agents for workflows in software engineering, interactive computing, autonomous database management, and voice-driven application control.

**Intelligent Systems: LLM-integrated use cases such as code generation, data preparation, and content moderation; the impact of Digital Twins for modeling, simulating, and optimizing real-world systems, especially for sustainability.

As usual, this year features leading experts from academia and industry. Our program includes talks, tutorials, and panel discussions.

**June 17, 2025 (AgentOps Day): Keynotes, sessions, and discussions focused on operationalizing intelligent agents.
