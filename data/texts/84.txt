Special Issue information

Blockchain technology supports decentralized, transparent, and immutable
transaction execution and storage. The advent of smart contracts has
provided the opportunity to apply these characteristics for managing
digital and real-world assets, and for  running business logic on
blockchain platforms. As blockchain technology has advanced, adoption from
both industry and academia has steadily increased, driving efforts to
develop new, trustworthy Blockchain‑based Information Systems (BISs).  This
was possible thanks to the blockchain's execution environment, offering
additional trust guarantees to execute multi-party collaborations, and
enhancing auditing and verification activities.  Indeed, blockchain enables
mutually distrusting parties to share data in a trusted way, without
requiring third-party authorities.

However, the distinctive nature of this technology and its application in
novel information systems raise new challenges from different perspectives
and at different levels.  From a conceptual perspective, important
challenges revolve around requirements engineering, modeling, integration,
governance, and the evolution of BISs.  From a technical perspective, the
development of BISs raises challenges related to data sharing, data
management, system optimization, and the adoption of novel on- and
off-chain solutions.

This special issue aims to advance the state of BISs and their engineering
by addressing conceptual and technical challenges at different levels.
Responding to such challenges requires innovative research and solutions to
strengthen the maturity of blockchain technology for information systems.

The special issue invites theoretical, conceptual, technical, and practical
contributions on various topics related to Blockchain-based Information
Systems (BISs), including:
