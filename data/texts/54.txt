Introduction
The SDU Software Engineering section at the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute (Faculty of Engineering) invites applications for a 2-year postdoctoral position in software engineering and artificial intelligence, which will be vacant from 1 August 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter. The position is part of the Nudge2Green project, focusing on the development of intelligent software solutions to influence and support sustainable food choices among consumers.
In this role, the postdoc will conduct cutting-edge research on AI-driven nudging tools that encourage environmentally friendly decision-making in everyday food consumption. The postdoctoral researcher will collaborate with external project partners, including Aarhus University, University of Copenhagen, the Food Organization of Denmark, and Heco et al., to exchange insights on markets, consumer behavior, sustainable food, and technical and data requirements. The collaboration with the interdisciplinary team, including experts in software engineering, artificial intelligence, and behavioral science, will facilitate evaluating the effectiveness of the digital nudging approaches and publishing the findings in high-impact venues. Moreover, the postdoc will actively support the management of SDU-led work packages, including coordinating deliverables, assisting with project reporting, and facilitating communication across the project consortium.

What we offer
We offer a dynamic and supportive research environment within an internationally recognized institute. You will join an open, collaborative team that values teamwork, professional diligence, and innovation. The Software Engineering section provides flexible work conditions and strong support for individual development, including mentorship and opportunities to expand your skills and responsibilities.
As part of the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute, our section is involved in a variety of national and European research projects and enjoys a robust network of academic and industrial partners. This position provides an opportunity to engage with these collaborations and work on real-world challenges. We encourage and support our postdocs to publish their research in renowned journals and conferences, and to engage in knowledge exchange with colleagues and external research and industrial partners. The working language is English, and we pride ourselves on a diverse, inclusive, and inspiring workplace that fosters personal and professional growth.

What we expect
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate who meets the following qualifications and characteristics:

  *   PhD (completed or soon to complete) in Software Engineering, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, or a closely related field.
  *   Strong software development and programming skills, with experience in designing and implementing complex software systems.
  *   Research experience in artificial intelligence and/or machine learning methods.
  *   Familiarity with or interest in behavioral software systems – for example, development of applications or tools that incorporate nudging, persuasive technology, or behavior change techniques.
  *   Experience with data-driven user modeling and AI-driven personalization (e.g., recommender systems, user profiling, or adaptive user interfaces) is highly desirable.
  *   Knowledge of or a passion for sustainable computing or sustainability-related projects (e.g., applying computing solutions to environmental or societal challenges) will be considered an advantage.
  *   Proficiency in English (written and spoken) and excellent communication skills.
  *   Ability to work both independently and collaboratively in an interdisciplinary team.
  *   A strong research record or potential, demonstrated by publications or other research outputs in relevant fields, is an advantage.
