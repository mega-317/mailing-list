Dear colleagues,

We are looking for a highly motivated postdoc researcher to work together with us in the KKS-funded project "OPEHRA: Operationalisng Human Rights in the Design of AI-supported Digital Health" (see full description below).

This is an intrinsically multidisciplinary project that deals with the meaningful integration of human rights in the software engineering lifecycle of our partners in the private and public sectors, focusing on digital health and social care AI systems. Beyond human rights, we also consider aspects of AI fairness and bias, gender equality, privacy and data protection rights.

Please disseminate it to potential candidates that you may know, and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
Best wishes,
/Leonardo

Postdoctoral position in Computer Science, OPEHRA
LINK HERE: https://kau.varbi.com/en/what:job/jobID:822208/iframeEmbedded:0/where:4

Sapere Aude – dare to know – is our motto. Our students and employees develop important knowledge that enrich both the individual and the community. Our academic environment is characterised by curiosity, courage and openness, with a close connection between people, professional roles, disciplines and research. Gender equality, diversity and a democratic approach form the foundation of our organisation. Located in Värmland, a scenic region with a rich cultural life, we are committed to promoting sustainable development in close collaboration with the wider community.

Karlstad University has a total of approximately 1,400 employees and 17,700 students spread across two inspiring campus environments in Karlstad and Arvika. More information at: kau.se/en/work-with-us

Description
Due to the postdoctoral appointment’s nature as a career-development position for junior researchers, we are looking for candidates who have completed their PhD no more than three years before the application deadline.

The Faculty of Health Science and Technology has an opening for a full-time post-doctoral research fellow in Computer Science with a focus on Impact and Risk Assessments, Artificial Intelligence, and Digital Health and Social Care Systems. The position is available within the Privacy & Security (PriSec) research group at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science.

The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science consists of two research subjects: Mathematics and Computer Science. It has a research and teaching staff of more than 70 people. In Computer Science, research and education are focused on computer networking and distributed systems, computer security and privacy, and software engineering. Both research and education are conducted in close cooperation with international, national, and regional partners from both academia and industry.

We offer a vibrant workplace with students, staff, and visitors from all over the world, as well as generous annual holidays, wellness allowance, and a favourable occupational pension scheme.

Duties
The postdoctoral fellow will conduct research together with business partners in the field of AI-based systems for digital health, with a focus on impact and risk assessments, carrying out qualitative case study research, and developing AI literacy materials (e.g., covering topics of AI risks, bias, fairness and ethical aspects, and suitable methods and tools for risk analysis). In addition, the postdoctoral fellow is also expected to contribute to teaching activities in the department, teaching may therefore be included in the duties, up to a maximum of 20% of working time

The postdoctoral fellow will work on an externally funded project, OPEHRA, which is an academia and business collaboration project funded by the Knowledge Foundation of Sweden. OPEHRA deals with the research problem of operationalising human rights in the design of AI-based systems for health and social care. To do so, the project examines existing methods for assessing risks to fundamental rights, mapping controls for risk mitigation, and managing tensions across multiple dimensions (e.g., human rights, privacy, security, fairness, robustness). The project also aims to co-create AI literacy materials with the business partners that can be further employed by digital health players, as well as translate research findings for broad dissemination. The project activities involve an interdisciplinary team of computer science and gender studies researchers, together with professionals in the industry and public sector, co-producing research and knowledge to the benefit of the Swedish industry.

You are expected to collaborate with the wider community for a mutual exchange, as well as work towards ensuring that the knowledge and expertise available at the university are of benefit to society.

To contribute to a positive work environment and further the department’s activities, you are expected to be a present and active part of the day-to-day operations and workplace community.
