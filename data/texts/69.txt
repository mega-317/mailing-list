Dear All

applications are invited for a postdoctoral research fellow position at 
the National University of Singapore (NUS). The position will focus on 
agentic AI approaches towards software engineering.  The group at NUS 
has research expertise in program repair, fuzzing and symbolic 
execution, and details of the research group hosting the postdoc can be 
found from

*https://nus-tss.github.io/*

For this specific position, we are building on our recent work on 
*AutoCodeRover*, an early agent for software engineering, which has 
since been acquired as a spinoff, and the effort is being continued for 
usage, deployment and continued learning from the efforts.  The post-doc 
candidate will thus join our SPARTAN effort on agents at NUS

*https://spartan-nus.github.io/*

NUS is a leading comprehensive university in Asia providing ample 
opportunities and environment for career growth. Only candidates who 
have submitted PhD thesis or will be submitting soon can be considered. 
Interested candidates can email their CV and sample publications to
