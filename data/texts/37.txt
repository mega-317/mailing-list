==================


Ulm University, Germany, is a young research university with a focus on 
natural sciences, medicine and technology - ranking consistently in the 
top 10% worldwide in the THE World University ranking. Located in an 
economically strong region in southern Germany, the University with its 
more than 10,000 students offers a dynamic work environment with 
attractive networking and development prospects.

The Faculty of Engineering, Computer Science and Psychology, the 
Institute of Software Engineering and Programming Language, is seeking 
to fill the position, starting as soon as possible, of a

Assistant Professor (W1) of Software Engineering
(no tenure track)

We are seeking an exceptional candidate with an international track 
record in the field of software engineering to strengthen the area of 
practical computer science at Ulm University with respect to research 
and teaching. Experience in acquiring third-party funding and 
participation in collaborative research projects is advantageous, 
enabling future large-scale research projects. An E13 doctoral student 
position is available to support the assistant professor.

The successful candidate will propose a research program that 
strengthens and complements the research expertise in the institute, the 
faculty and the university as a whole. The university provides an ideal 
setting for the assistant professor, with numerous opportunities for 
interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange. Additionally, the Science 
City of Ulm and the Transfer Center for Digitization, Analytics & Data 
Science offer further connections and partnerships with local companies.

We are looking for an individual with a passion for teaching to 
strengthen our teaching portfolio for our software engineering B.Sc. and 
M.Sc. programs. Basic-level instruction is offered in German while 
advanced courses may be taught in English. We expect strong teaching 
skills, documented, for example, by excellent teaching evaluations or 
continued educational training. Active participation in the faculty’s 
self-administration is expected.

Recruitment takes place as a temporary civil servant or as an employee, 
generally for a fixed term of 6 years. An extension is not possible 
except in the cases of § 45 Para 6 LHG.

Employment requirements are completed university studies as well as 
teaching aptitude, a doctoral degree and special aptitude for academic 
work, which is usually demonstrated by the outstanding quality of a 
doctorate (§ 51 Abs. 2 LHG).

The University is seeking to increase the proportion of women in 
research and teaching and particularly encourage qualified female 
scientists to apply for this position. Severely disabled applicants with 
equal aptitude will be given preferential consideration.
