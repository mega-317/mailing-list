It aims to assist junior researchers in starting empirical work in software engineering and informatics by providing practical, hands-on exercises. The summer school will cover major research methods, study design, and will focus on delivering immediate value to participants through case studies and discussions related to their own research topics.",

      "Call for Participation to the ERMSEI 2025 Summer School",
      "September 1-5, 2025, Centre de recherche INRIA/ IRISA, Rennes, France.",
      "The ERMSEI Summer School is the place to go if you are a junior researcher and want to start doing empirical work in a Software Engineering or Informatics context but don't know how or lack a local support system.",
      "The goal of this summer school is to get junior researchers started on using empirical research methods on software engineering topics.",
      "We emphasize practical, hands-on exercises throughout the course because that is the only way to really get going.",
      "We will try to work on your research topics as much as possible, delivering real and immediate value to participants.",
      "We will cover all major research methods, i.e., controlled experiments, a selection of qualitative methods, and the major approaches to secondary research.",
      "The whole summer school is based on case studies of actual published empirical research, and quite possibly your own research projects."
